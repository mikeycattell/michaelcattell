    Getting into "the industry" seems to me, as a difficult journey that might lead to mass confusion and sleepless nights.
</p>

<p>
    So, the plan is to have a self-service "thing", where basically the program is powered by your own effort and want for getting a portfolio.
    <br> As the program is open up to both designers and developers (UX Developers), I can whip up designers, or briefs and give you the design or development leadership that will help you in a design agency or company set-up, and I will guide you as much
    as possible.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Being stuck isn't much fun - so shout me if this happens!</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>So how will it will work?</strong></p>
<p>I come up with an idea (like an agency/company would), mock up an idea in Sketch, or hand over a brief (this is where you would ask the questions) - give you the raw file with fonts included (if needed / google font link) if i've designed it, then leave
    the rest to you - with minimal direction on how I would do it, we all love a challenge right?.
</p>

<p>
    A new project every month, depending how quick you progress.
</p>

<p><strong>What I won't do:</strong></p>
<p>Chase you up to do it - you have 1-2 months to get it done, nothing I give you will need more than a weekend if you go at it 100%. Sooner you do it, quicker you get a new job!</p>
<p><strong>What you'll get:</strong></p>
<p>At the end of this: you should hae a portfolio big enough to show your workings, a new CV/resume we can work through, a reference that I can provide, a website with your work on - including a blogging platform.</p>

<p>Sound good? If so - <a href="contact.html">get in touch!</a></p>
