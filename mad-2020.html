    <h3 class="intro">The Problem</h3>
    <p>I was approached by Ahoy Agency (I had worked with Ahoy Agency often in the past) to deliver a website for one of their clients. The brief was to listen to the clients direction, and deliver something that would "wow them". They did not have a brand, so it was from scratch, and it needed to help show off their other restaurants.<br>There was also a need for the website to be a CMS, so we decided upon using WordPress.</p>
</div>

<div class="col grid-ninety">
    <h3 class="intro">The Solution</h3>
    <p>A visually appealing website with huge photography showcasing their amazing restaurants, which was easy to navigate and use. The client was delighted with the final result.</p> 
</div>

<div class="col grid-ninety">
    <h3 class="intro">My Responsibilites</h3>
    <p>Website strategy, prototype, design, regular feedback sessions with client and account manager, design iterations, development (WordPress), email design and build.</p>
