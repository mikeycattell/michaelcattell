      </div>
  
 
  <p>I took a little time off doing weeknotes as it didn’t feel right sharing the work I was doing due to it being so fast, needed, and also so important right now for the country.<br />
Since my last update, I’ve worked in multiple workshops, made many service views, enjoyed some challenges, hated some challenges, and felt overwhelmed with life in general.<br />
It’s also worth noting that dealing with work demands, and family demands have also been a challenge - one that many has spoken about, and one <a href="https://michaelcattell.com/2020/04/20/living-and-working-at-home.html" title="my blog post on living and working at home">I wrote about previously</a> (to a lot of positive feedback too which I’m really grateful for).<br />
I have also started to post to <a href="https://dribbble.com/mikeycattell" title="click here to see my dribbble account">@dribbble</a> with timeboxed design exercises to push my visual skills and also keep me fresh, on trends and to put any creative need to output in action!</p>

<p><strong>Monday</strong><br />
In the past couple of weeks, I’ve really deep-dived into the Service Design role which I’ve really enjoyed and found it really helpful to one team in particular.<br />
I’ve also spent a lot of the last couple of weeks aligning the team to be User-centered and trying to remove barriers of discomfort not knowing the answer, it’s been a great challenge - helping me to really stretch my communication skills amongst many differing job-types and really selling the value of design and knowing it actually was effective is great feedback.</p>

<p>The first test of this was to educate to a team the value of design using a simple method I do that is along the lines of “process mapping”, so getting the team to split into two, getting them to “invent” the service journey from start to end - not a user journey but a service journey.<br />
Along the way, they MUST write down who does this task, how they do this task, any risks, and what questions do we have about it.</p>

<p>The output is always the same (so far) - the team on the same knowledge level, it’s a quick way to get the team co-design (and to show the value of co-design), and we have invented “discovery” backlog - the questions, the risks.</p>

<p>Easy peasy? Kinda.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday</strong><br />
Realising my workload of recent times has been far too much, I decided to step down from a service team I was on (thankfully we have just hired an additional designer, so I managed to on-board him whilst working alongside him).<br />
My last meeting with the team was to help direct them through their Discovery process - it’s a good feeling to know that people see you have a helper and (possible?) leader, we spoke through the point of discovery, what the (possible) point of their discovery is and what/how to deliver (thinking about presentations to stakeholders and what to share).</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday</strong><br />
Today felt totally different, my workload has halved and my happiness, therefore, has doubled.<br />
This means more time to think, more time to reply to emails and more time to mentor a couple of people within DWP that I’ve had to park for a while.</p>

<p>But fortunately for them, I’m back with time - so they can expect plenty of direction!<br />
I’ve even had time and motivation to write weekly notes again - finally.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday</strong><br />
 Back to my original (and in my opinion best obviously) team, working on decommissioning a service that we all worked hard to get up and running, but now it’s time to close it down due to completing its task. It’s been a great learning curve for the team to build it, and now to close it down is an even great one - thinking about all touchpoints, data storage, any user requirements and confirming the overall need to actually stop using the service.</p>

<p>Working alongside one of my favourite PM’s means this is an easy task to run through, and I also get to dust down my interaction design chops - which I’ve left to go a little rusty!</p>

<p><strong>Friday</strong><br />
A quick catch up with the brilliant Content Designer whilst we discussing closing a service down, and how do we do it to actually help not hinder the end-user and inform them what to do next.</p>

<p>A presentation to one of the new starters about what we’ve been working on for the last year or so, and then early finish to go for a lovely walk with my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_aRxcQpTiI/" title="a link to my instagram account">fluffy dog</a> and chatterbox daughter!</p>

<p><strong>Good things</strong><br />
Something I’ve missed a lot of the past year has been line-management duties or mentoring consistently.<br />
This is about to change as I was picked to be on the <a href="https://www.outofofficehours.com/may-2020/volunteers">Out of office hours month of mentors</a>, and I’m so excited to start. I’ve already got a lot of requests to help new starters to the industry and also people just feeling in a rut.</p>

<p><strong>Learned things</strong><br />
Mentioned previously, it’s just been a good learning curve to know when to step back, give tasks to others, and realise I have other priorities. I feel a lot calmer now the rush of work needed has gone (for now).</p>

<p><strong>Difficulties</strong><br />
The lack of control at the moment of my own life and work has me in a spin. I had feelings of anxiety, anger, caged in, boredom, and just general stress.<br />
The power of having GOOD people around you - whether to take work off you or people just having a normal conversation is brilliant and really not spoken about enough.</p>

<p><strong>Achievements</strong><br />
Feeling relieved my workload has halved and now I have time to think, to recover, and spend time with my family in the sun!</p>
