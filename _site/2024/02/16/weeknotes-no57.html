  <p>Another week of working in the open, showing, presenting and teaching.<br />
Loads of takeaway learning moments, a bag full of excited stakeholders and a project that is almost at the finishing line.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bobbin and Bumble is gearing up for its moment in the spotlight, which is so hush-hush, even I’m not allowed to spill the beans.</p>

<p>Perhaps a bit early, but I wanted to let you know that I’ll be available for interaction design contracts from April. I’m looking forward to <a href="/contact.html">exploring new opportunities and collaborations</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What did I enjoy:</strong><br />
This week has been intense, but in a - let’s get this thing out there and doing its thing.<br />
This has involved sharing links, receiving very good feedback (with solutions.. hurrah) and having normal, adult conversations about scaling and what happens next (after I depart from the role).<br />
We’ve also had 1:1 training sessions with designers, helping them initially to install or run the prototype kit in a world where proxy settings are my enemy and the hardware isn’t quite up to the task.</p>

<p>We’ve also been back in presentation mode, talking to stakeholders across the business to gain buy-in (we have this now) and traction to make the design system an almost compulsory “thing” to follow when designing FCA products and services - which, at one point didn’t look likely but I feel this is a huge step and one I’m so happy it’s happening!</p>

<p>In the space of 3-4 months, we are rolling out a design system and prototype kit and I know I’ll look back at this (possibly when I write up the case study) and think - wow, you did this in a short period with multiple challenges faced and many conquered. I need a cake!<br />
The past couple of weeks and months have been tough, and challenging but it proves - with a strategy to roll things out, including the right people and speaking and presenting to keep (the right) people in the loop, anything is possible.</p>

<p>Redesigning an optician website this week, met the client and all is a go-go, it’s one of the nicest designs I’ve done in a while, so I’m delighted with their feedback and trust given to me to provide them something that will edge themselves and their in-shop rebrand over local competitors and brands that spend far more on advertisement, allowing them to go for the boutique and experience vibe they want.</p>

<p><strong>What am I looking forward to next week?</strong><br />
Bit of a pattern now, but I just love seeing the prototype kit in people’s hands, seeing what damage they can cause moving the needle towards a more inclusive, consistent process and being a developer’s best friend when handing over a working thing with moving parts that just works.</p>

<p>Bobbin and Bumble is having a grown-up moment next week, which I couldn’t be more excited for.. but I’ll let that news be presented by someone else.. aka the owner, not me!</p>

<p>As mentioned, my current contract as Lead Interaction Designer comes to an end soon, please get in touch if you need someone like me.</p>
