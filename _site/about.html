            <p>Here is a brief history of me, what I do and why I could be your best friend.</p>
            <p>I live and work in Leeds with my wife Emma, our two superstar kids, and our little dog Ralph. I’m a fan of football, <a href="https://untappd.com/user/mikeycattell" title="look at my poorly used untappd account">craft beers</a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/designmikey" title="see my steam list">retro game player</a>, terrible jokes, serial cake testing, and listening to a lot of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/mikeycattell" title="check my profile out on spotify">music and podcasts</a>.</p>
                    <p>I am also the design-gatekeeper for our family run business <a href="https://www.bobbinandbumble.com/" title="">Bobbin and Bumble</a>.</p>

            <p>With over 16 years of experience being a curious designer in public and private sectors, agency and contracting roles for clients of all sizes, specialising in leading and facilitating design, designing clean interfaces, as well as plotting services and products from discovery to launch.</p>

            <p>I do all of this by telling memorable stories to describe the work I am on - using strategy, research, visual design, and user-centered design approach to complex design problems.<br>
            I'm passionate about all of my work, giving my 100% in each project, totally committing to delivering a solution of a high standard.</p>
