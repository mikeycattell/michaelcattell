      </div>
  
 
  <p>It’s been a while since I last wrote, I took Purdah as a chance to recharge my batteries, read over my past notes and see where I was, where I am and where I wish to go and do a 2019 review.</p>

<p>It’s been a wild one, over the year my daughter turned 4, my wife upped her business to another level and I changed jobs.</p>

<p>Work:
In May, I decided to leave Sky Bet - quite possibly one of my favourite places of work (when Perm) to move to another favourite place of work - Department for Work and Pensions (when Contracting), I expected the change of workplace to really challenge me and push me to my limits.</p>

<p>I certainly wasn’t disappointed.</p>

<p><strong>Daughter Update:</strong>
2019 has been a whacky year, watching my daughter grow up into a strong(er), indepedant person who has her own ideas, sayings and jokes whilst being so eager to learn and listen.
Every week, she does something which inspires me to push myself further, either its her asking a question about “why am i grumpy after work?”, or “why do I need to leave the house so much?” to her managing to learn something which seems impossible at the start - but she still carries on and keeps going. Even if she gets upset, she tries again and again.</p>

<p>Having a child has changed me</p>

<p>The positives feedback I received in Sky Bet I took with me, involving:
speaking out more (confidently) about work,
supporting colleagues,
share design workings,
work together to gain a process we all buy into to,</p>
