  <p>My first week at Department for Work and Pensions.<br /><br />
<em>Or: holy moly, it’s full of acronyms. </em><br /><br />
As expected, it was going to be totally brain mashing, but I really enjoyed myself and feel totally out of my comfort zone - which for me is a huge positive challenge that I craved for.</p>

<p><strong>Monday</strong><br />
Found my desk, filled in a little paperwork and tried to work out what I was doing (in general), also a design meet-up allowed me to meet the other Interaction Designers.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday</strong><br />
First trip to work from Harrogate (Job Centre), really good introduction to the team and a great insight into what I’ll be working on via a workshop. A lot to be said sitting back and people watching at this point (allowed by the no pressure put on me by the team).</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday / Thursday</strong><br />
Setting up MacBook, sitting with Andy and Sam to find more out about the service and ask 105 questions. </p>

<p><strong>Friday</strong><br />
Feeling fully immersed in the team and kicking off my first task and getting to grips with the prototyping tool once again (how I’ve missed you).<br />
Also, first run in 3 years and managed 2k without stopping!</p>

<p><strong>Good things</strong><br />
Should be called great things - the team has made me feel very welcome, and really assisted in myself settling in as quickly as I have.</p>

<p><strong>Learned things</strong><br />
As mentioned previously, staying quiet and listening sometimes is the quickest way to learn, remembering all those questions for a later time.</p>

<p><strong>Difficulties</strong><br />
Tough to understand what was happening initially, and reminding myself to be ok with not knowing (as its my first week or even first month(s)).</p>

<p><strong>Achievements</strong><br />
Confidence gained from being comfortable in myself to speak up, and having a team that makes me feel included as often as possible (shout out to Si, Andy and Sam for this!).</p>
