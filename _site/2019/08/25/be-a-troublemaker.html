  <p>Ever since I can remember, Iâ€™ve always had an opinion, the unwritten benefit of having cockney parents means Iâ€™m very ok to communicate my disapproval or if I disagree with everything.<br />
I class this as a skill, a gift - the ability to have the confidence and comfort of speaking my thoughts and challenging on what I believe to be wrong or right.</p>

<p>In all honestly, this confidence has not always been there, this happened and evolved over time - learning when to speak, when to listen and when to support.</p>

<p>Getting to this point meant breaking it all down into simple chunks.</p>

<p><strong>When to listen:</strong><br /></p>

<p>If there is a skill I always teach, itâ€™s this one.Â </p>

<blockquote>Just stop talking.</blockquote>

<p>During my time at Sky Bet, it was important that I listened as much as possible to people who were not designers, letting them have the power of the room, empowering them to have opinions on something they donâ€™t have much knowledge on and allowing the sense of comfort in the room.<br />
This (right) approach means fantastic decisions can be made by the non-designers who are just-as creative - which is where I always want the teams I work in to be, and do everything in my skillset to get them there.
Getting this trust is not an easy task, you need to be a different type of designer, one that is not precious about design, one that is approachable and more importantly one that educates. <br />Personally opinion alert: this skillset splits up the good designers to the brilliant designers.<br /><br />
Here at DWP, itâ€™s no different - the need to hear the SMEâ€™s, or PMâ€™s, BAâ€™s, PTOâ€™s (I made that last one up) is so important to learn what the actual problem is and to put distance between the problem and the solution.</p>

<p><strong>How did I/we get the team to this point?</strong><br />
I have found so many techniques; giving each person a sharpie and a handful of post its is a big step for many designers, at first only a handful will speak and the rest will resort to writing it down - but eventually, a domino effect will happen and before you know it everyone is speaking, challenging and finding solutions that a single designer would never have thought of.</p>

<p>Some rules to this:<br /></p>
<ul>
	<li>I have never "picked on" the quietest person in the room - this is not a fair approach and its unfair to assume they have anything to add to the meeting (or want to).</li>
	<li>I have never told anyone to stop talking - unless they have spoken over others or are going off the script.</li>
	<li>I have never started a workshop or meeting without putting down <em>room-rules</em>, things like take turns to talk or (depending on numbers) hands up, write everything down, don't be a dick (work this one correctly to the tone of the room!), you have to stress its a safe-place - once you have simple rules in place - everything should and will flow better.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Support:</strong><br /></p>
