  <p>Wednesday was an eye-opening experience (as most UR sessions are), which changed everything for me, and really had notched my passion to ‚Äúgetting things done right‚Äù to another level.</p>

<p><strong>Monday</strong><br />
Workshop session for roadmap planning - vision setting, goal driven and reminding the team what the point of the pilot is (not scale driven but whether we are doign it right).
Pre-planning meeting - design work tasks a plenty, what a difference working alongside the team makes! Lets go!</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday</strong><br />
User testing a very early version of a ‚Äúcalc‚Äù, a very busy process to get to the end - will be reviewing my notes (whilst chatting to the user) and presenting back to the team what I believe needs to be done - in a cheap and timely manner.<br />
And then run through again with the user and see what happens!</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday</strong><br />
Hopped on the train Chesterfield for another User Research session. This one was fascinating, one of my favourite ever URs. I even took a session (if you know me you‚Äôll know I don‚Äôt often!).</p>

<p>Think these tweets explain it more:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today was one of those days at work, where you know you are in the right place, for the right reasons and you have to do it for other people - the users.<br /><br />Incredibly motivating, and the future feeling of satisfaction from succeeding will be HUGE.</p>&mdash; Mikey Cattell (@mikeycattell) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeycattell/status/1156660728939589633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2019</a></blockquote>

<p><br />
<strong>Thursday</strong><br />
Morning de-brief on the findings from yesterday, the team has escalated the findings and I‚Äôm excited for the team to fix these issues, and also grateful as I know the end-users will really appreciate the support and feeling of ‚Äúbeing heard‚Äù.</p>

<p>Sprint planning, with showing value of design we know, have allocated slots of time to do content reviews, design amends, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Friday</strong><br />
Worked on planning the on-boarding pdf for new starters to the team.
Planning for an interview for next week (I‚Äôm the interviewer).</p>

<p><strong>Good things</strong><br />
Wednesday was the best / most interesting User Research session I‚Äôve ever been part of, and really showed the gap of ‚Äúwho is the user‚Äù, and why I do what I do.</p>

<p><strong>Learned things</strong><br />
Back to Wednesday, it is always great to be reminded that I am part of designing a service, not just a product. This is why I joined, I wanted to design more than just things on a screen, and that is most certainly my role here!</p>

<p><strong>Difficulties</strong><br />
Back to Wednesday again, it was so tough seeing the users struggle with the ‚Äúunseen‚Äù part of the service, but knowing we will fix it is a good feeling.</p>

<p><strong>Achievements</strong><br />
Leading on from last week, and my <a href="https://michaelcattell.com/2019/08/04/having-a-wobble.html" title="read my previous post about my wobble">previous post</a>, this week was so different - having the team watch the users in action, and hear our feedback has changed the complete dynamic and I could not be more proud of this situation (and the team).</p>
