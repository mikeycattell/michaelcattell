  <p>A lonnnnng week. <br />
Work-wise I’m in the phase of being unsure what to work on, there are bigger things to look at, but immediate work to do - one of those weeks!
News around schools in Leeds being threatened and having them put in a “lockdown”, was shit, the world my kids are growing up within needs to look long and hard at its-self and have a talk.</p>

<p><strong>What did I enjoy:</strong><br />
I gathered all of the user journeys from our 1st week to this a week or so before the end of alpha - showing vast iterations powered by user research sessions, presentations to subject matter experts (SMEs) and wider team(s) input and we find ourselves at a good point.<br />
Seeing the above work laid on in Mural, and seeing the changes we have done from initial thoughts (we all need a starting point) to where we are now is great and reminds me of the shift we’ve all put in.</p>

<p>Listing all our assumptions, some we’ve found out, some still unanswered, and a handful we’ll look at during private beta - love this part where we start to measure against good vs. not good.</p>

<p>Being asked to present “how I settle into teams” is great, just need to remember what the heck I do and write a thing up.</p>

<p>Finally left the house and met a pal that I hadn’t seen for years, in fact he once hired me when he overheard me mention at a bar (whilst ordering a drink) that I just left a project styling out a Magento theme (remember those days?).. cue me walking into his office the next day on my first day.</p>

<p><strong>What challenged me:</strong><br />
My daughter’s school issued warnings about being held in lockdown due to some idiots putting threats into schools. The world is fucking mad when kids are under threat.</p>

<p>Working out what to work on first, it’s been tricky to prioritise, whilst it’s not a huge mass - it’s tough to work out what to do first and whether I need to do it at all. The difference between working as a consultant and a freelancer is the challenge here, as a consultant I would be expected to do everything, here I am expected to deliver high-end interaction outputs - which is much easier, but…I do not work slowly so I’m ahead of schedule!</p>

<p><strong>What am I looking forward to next week?</strong><br />
I am presenting to the design community next week on how I settled in, and I’m looking forward to that, taking any questions and seeing if my process is right if there are places I could work, and gaps I could fill.</p>

<p><strong>Podcast of the week:</strong><br />
Decided to reach into the vault and start to listen to one of my favourite speakers - Mike Monterio. And <a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/mule-design-mike-monteiro/">this episode</a> is his usual hard-hitting, direct speaking way, which I’m a huge fan of.</p>

<p><strong>Tune of the week:</strong><br />
Found a band that screams, plays violin and is VERY good - Imminence, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNAD360Op_8">this track</a> is a complete banger.</p>
