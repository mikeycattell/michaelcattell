  <p>As discussed on LinkedIn, I have decided to change the format as the previous way was a slog to write up. My team is far too balanced and controlled for there to be much change within what I do each day, whilst the work changes - the structure doesn’t (which I’m a fan of right now).<br />
So the new layout is hopefully easier to read, easier to write and just more fun in general, and whilst I might drop into days, it just won’t be like before.</p>

<p><strong>What did I enjoy:</strong><br /></p>

<p>We discussed future issues around possible assurance needs, and this is where GOOD problems lie, because this team has done the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard" title="building a service to the service standard">build-by-the-book</a> - gathering all the needed paperwork to present to whoever needs it, is going to be a doddle. Teams - do your work, and do it properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>With the above, I always revert to Vicky's fantastic post about <a href="https://www.vickyteinaki.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-the-service-standard" title="read Vicky's brilliant the history of the service standard">the history of the service standard</a>, as <a href="https://twitter.com/vickytnz">Vicky</a> is an absolute A* designer / colleague / pal, she has included a link to a very useful Mural board too.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of my design recommendations were presented and accepted by the core and wider team and have been put into “Dev-ready”, which was supported by the brilliant design team in preparation for the presentation, this means we are making more (user-led) improvements to an important service that will help millions of people, all fueled by user research, design system patterns and experience.</p>

<p>Having the call that my contract was extended till the end of August, which is great as I’m enjoying the work and challenges that come with it.</p>

<p><strong>What challenged me:</strong><br />
Leading design meetings every Monday is a test, not because the team is challenging, but a test in regards to my prioritising what needs to be done - effort vs value. I am very comfortable presenting and Monday has almost become “the Mikey show”.<br />
I have a need to write a case study for my past project at NHS, but it’s not as easy, not because I have a bad memory but mostly because it was just a tough project.. but keep an eye out for that soon.</p>

<p><strong>What am I looking forward to next week?</strong><br />
<a href="https://mansmarkets.com/">Mans Market</a> on Mother’s day! FOOOOOOOD!</p>

<p>We have iteration v2 coming up, and I’m gifted the reigns on it to lead - which means I’m a trusted team member now which is amazing and I cant wait to start doing what I do best, bringing the team under one roof (be it Figma) and start ideation sessions and finding great solutions to great problems.</p>

<p>Also, it wouldn’t be weeknotes without a retro update - I’m also excited for my SNES to arrive this week.. just need to start buying games for it AND hot off the press… a Mega Drive - WOO.</p>

<p><strong>Song of the week:</strong><br />
To describe this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@yx98" title="check out YX's youtube channel">artist’s youtube</a> would not be fair in a short comment, just go and watch a handful of YX’s videos. His songs are next level too - really recommend Last Ride, Out her Space, Good Things, and Mad, he’s up on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2Fv2ioUtRdjP2i5ilLcDPs?si=LtVmnlDgRLmv12jdbHEFlg" title="check out YX's music">Spotify</a> if thats your thing.</p>
