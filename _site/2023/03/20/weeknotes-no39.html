      </div>
  
 
  <p>Itâ€™s been a great week, people have been in touch, commenting how my week-notes were useful and clearer which will do me.</p>

<p>Leading meetings, design work and being in the thick of things have brought back my design-mojo, and mentoring again is such a fulfilling thing that I must insist we all do it, whatever level, whatever job - always pass it on.<br />
We also had a midweek stop off in Manchester for some cocktails, pies and friends - yes please.</p>

<p>Also, check out this weekâ€™s podcast recommendation - itâ€™s a goodâ€™un!</p>

<p><strong>What did I enjoy:</strong><br /></p>

<p>Catching up with past directs (people I line-managed in the past) was a great highlight, being asked for advice still feels great and knowing I can provide this from experience feels like my worry of losing and missing line-management duties is a thing of the past.<br />
Was asked to plan an ideation session, which, as a refresher allowed me to re-read past case studies and this one in imparticular around running <a href="https://michaelcattell.com/designsystem-2022.html" title="read my discovery for DWP design system">discovery for the DWP design system</a> (I will be re-writing this case study as my tone of voice doesnâ€™t sit right with me!)</p>

<p>Met my dearest friends that I use to knock around with in California all those years ago in Manchester as they do a tour of England, Evelyn and Jonathan. Was so much fun, we went to <a href="https://www.washhousemcr.com/">The Washhouse</a> in Manchester, it was cocktail mad (I was the driver so thankful they had a wicked selection of booze-free), what was brilliant was Emma booking the table for 2 hours thinking it did foodâ€¦ but we treated the lovely Americanâ€™s to <a href="https://pieminister.co.uk/">Pie Minister</a> - the pies of champions. Let us not leave it so soon to catch up with each other next time eh!</p>

<p>Still waiting for the sign and sealed contract for the extension.. will keep you posted.</p>

<p><strong>What challenged me:</strong><br />
Knowing my time working with a wicked content designer (Richard) is coming to an end this week is always sad, we have made some great strides together and have had a great relationship of challenge, support and growth - pushing each other on and being each others cheerleader when the workload has grown.
Jasperâ€™s sleeping habits.. this little angel child is 2, and still hasnâ€™t quite grasped how sleeping works, I on the other hand am 40 - I know how sleep works and how much Iâ€™m not getting!</p>

<p>Another thing that made me feel a little shaken, was knowing a friend who had a contract (his first) lined up for weeks, suddenly got pulled last minute, I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7041350908844068865/">posted it on Linkedin</a> - If you know anyone who needs a Developer, get in touch with Bernard!</p>

<p><strong>What am I looking forward to next week?</strong><br />
We have Mans Market on Sunday to celebrate Motherâ€™s day, which I can already feel hunger levels for.</p>

<p>The impending arrival of a Mega Drive, Nintendo Wii, Nintendo GameCube and the original Nintendo NES are all coming pretty soon. All of a sudden my office is going to look packed!</p>

<p><em>A warning - the links below are football heavy.. but hardly any football is discussed!</em></p>

<p><strong>Youtube of the week:</strong><br />
Certainly worth a watch is the interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76TUYCuiwzI&amp;t=5715s">Kevin Ball on the podcast Under the Cosh (youtube link)</a>, I remember this guy to be a tough player who played hard on the field, but what a great speaker and knowledge of people within the team environment.</p>

<p><strong>Podcast of the week:</strong><br />
This one is the recommendation this week, I demand you listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0vtGdp5nMldzCvEG8P1AU8?si=65ac8fb0bed546b9">The High Performance Podcast with Ryan Mason(Spotify link)</a>, who, now an ex-footballer who left it all due to a very bad injury to become the youngest manager in the Premier League, a shared experience of ups and downs and incredible drive to succeed in trying circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Tune of the week:</strong><br />
Last week I recommended tracks that were easy listening, this week Iâ€™m going all in, volume 11 screamo, get your ears ready:<br />
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2mizO0RNubPdTJqmrmMhfi?si=7072783712df4cbb">The Ghost Inside - The Outcast (Spotify link)</a>.</p>
