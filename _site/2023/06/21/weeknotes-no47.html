  <p>Hayfever has been awful this week or two, surely there has to be a cure for it by now?
It’s been a hard couple of weeks, really intense in regards to work we are doing whilst planning for work we need to do, all before the impending end-of-alpha deadline.<br />
Life is great right now, spending loads of time with the kids and wife, making our house our own… slowly but surely.</p>

<p>I still can’t believe I leapt to contracting, but it feels good right now.</p>

<p><strong>What did I enjoy:</strong><br />
Presenting, I love showing the work we did as a team and selling, or should I reword that - SHOWING the value of having a designer in the room to facilitate and bring together knowledge sharing and problem solving under one roof, all tied up into a handy output (in this case an Experience map).</p>

<p>This week is the first week we spoke and got deep with the SMEs, again - having more heads in the room (especially those who do the do) and providing that knowledge is key, and such a valuable key to delivering a successful service.</p>

<p>Again, my old directs (from months, and years ago) all got in touch coincidently to discuss their careers, life at home and balancing it all. Suddenly, with two kids, my wife and I being self-employed have them believing we know what we are doing.. but aside from that, the feeling they give me when they get in touch is huge thumbs.</p>

<p><strong>What challenged me:</strong><br />
Hayfever. Fuck hayfever.</p>

<p>Now we have all these outputs from the workshops, planning what next, what to do with the outputs, who to show, and why to show it (usual questions).</p>

<p><strong>What am I looking forward to next week?</strong><br />
Settling down, getting into the work without distractions of.. dare I say - workshops (although we do have one incoming which I will be leading!).<br />
Prototyping some basic journeys to provide shape and context for review, and more mural flow diagrams for feedback.
Sounds much like an earphones-in-and-get-shit-done week to me!</p>

<p><strong>Read of the week:</strong><br />
Depression has played a part in my life, not directly affected but very closely in contact with it, and this one-off tweet by Stan Collymore was the tweet that helped me understand and, I guess, at the least respect (and by respect I mean - I don’t know what I mean) depression during my early days of learning about the illness. It had a great effect on me and I’m grateful, for what is just a long tweet from someone coming through it and getting on the other side.
<a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/ecoqm1">Stan Collymore’s tweet about what he is going through</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Watch of the week:</strong><br />
My film intake has halved whilst I’m in full-on work and dad mode (kids holidays last week!), but I am looking forward to working through my list of films, and maybe putting a web page live listing films and my short take reviews.</p>

<p><strong>Podcast of the week:</strong><br />
I love Full Disclosure with James O’Brien and the episode with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/23F1a3Me9bj0toeQkjtSjf?si=be342a5c6e9245ae">Adrian Chiles</a> was brilliant. It made me look at my habits with alcohol, I am not a heavy drinker but his throwaway quote “We are all trying to just get the high of the first pint” is a keeper.</p>
