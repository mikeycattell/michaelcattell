        <title>Weeknotes No.10</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tuesday I got frustrated, Wednesday I learned loads and Friday I drove 350 miles.
Not an average week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Morning routine starts with a Design stand up with the wider team, aims of the week are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rebuild prototype&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;plan scenarios to assist with testing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plan a hypothesis board and possible whiteboard for tickets (design exclusive)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sit down with content designer to discuss some much requested design work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on in the day we have a workshop, running through the ideas for the next period of the year (P8) - coming up with ideas that we want to all concentrate on (pushing towards the idea that helps all teams and squads have the shared aim of all being UCD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Today was a no-meetings-and-pure-get-down-to-it work day! Getting my head around the prototype tool (building from scratch) was great, frustrating and incredibly rewarding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been many many years since I used it - but not its like I never went away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it works - its a brilliant little tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Had a round-table with a subject specialist - brilliant gathering and took so so many learnings from her, she started the journey that my team is on all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An afternoon spent discussing future UR plans and conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
UR again in Harrogate, nice to get away from the office and listen again to the users as much as possible.
Also bonus of being out of the office is having time to arrange (more) meetings for next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
WFH in the morning and worked on tallying up questions for a meeting with the PM to influence the roadmap session planned (to fill the gaps if design isnt included).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Wednesday, speaking to a past designer of the service was amazing, and reminded me that it can be so easy to find someone who has been there before, and learn learn learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Realising that so many differing projects have the same patterns of ‚Äúissues‚Äù, is enlightening and also motivating - the chance of teaming up with other designers is exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I need to start planning better for stand-ups, unsure if this means starting earlier (finishing earlier), or speaking less time checking on the team in a morning - or just being more dedicated to scribbling something down and planning better (if I am honest.. I know the answer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not work related - but I worked Flexi-time on Friday afternoon, and had the best weekend away in Cumbria with my wife and 3 year old. I loved this and reminds me over and over again to take more breaks and use Flexi!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.9</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The team feels so different since the product has gone live, we are presenting more and designing together around a table (this includes all of U.C. Leeds).&lt;br /&gt;
Also, design / user needs have taken a top seat at the table, first to be thought by P.Os and others ‚Äì interesting change for the team, one they really seem to be enjoying üëç.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Usual morning stand up with Universial Credit designers (but with huge technology fails (human led obvious.. maybe I led it.. maybe..)).&lt;br /&gt;
Afternoon session with ‚Äúmy other team‚Äù, doing a roadmap - loads of exciting stuff to work on over the next period. I certainly wont be moaning of being not busy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Morning was a catch up over Slack about what is expected (and needed) of us as designers - I really enjoyed this as it really feels we are supported and our voice will be heard (if its needed).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Catch up with my P.O. and ran through some feedback from previous UR to cement some user needs for the next sprint (planning is soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Full day of presenting work (Show and tell), and we are at the point where everyone is on the same page, feeling part of the team and its really really great to see.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3 Amigos on finding a fix, the fix was found within minutes - amazing when you have a developer / P.O who is comfortable with a sharpie and willing to draw on screen and amend it as we shout random feedback. Get your team to this level and designing is a piece of cake!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Final action of the day was a catch-up with my line-manager. The difference with our topics of discussion is incredible from my first, loads to celebrate and feel positive about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Morning starts with far too many weird (but funny) conversations at my desk (I blame the others), followed up with a sprint-planning session. Again - design being added as a ‚Äúmust-do‚Äù is a change of pace and I blinking LOVE IT!
Need to take this confidence further and allocate time to making something to show ideas for design - a physical board (something like a Hypothesis board?) - very happy for any ideas on this, does not have to work first time, but something is better than nothing right?.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Rest of the day: The product I‚Äôm working on has never had a prototype - sooooo.. I‚Äôm fixing that and will be testing it with users to fuel the ‚Äúthing‚Äù we do on the wall (hypothesis including to support it a feedback print out?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Slow day setting up the prototype - it‚Äôs turned into a bit of a task as I wish to build the prototype as simple as possible, including scenarios, so planning is needed (I never dive straight in anyways).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The roadmap session was a really good couple of hours, so good to see the route of the service led almost exclusively by the UR and user needs. One of my favourite roadmap sessions I‚Äôve ever been in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
routes.js has broken me, made me and frustrated me. If you know.. you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Reminding myself on how to use the prototype tool, I use to be really good and quick at using it and now.. it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve never used it before which has frustrated me endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Being told to ‚Äúfind design tickets‚Äù (not as open as it sounds) to do - total change of pace. My team should be endlessly proud of this change and embrace the request!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.8</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Week felt really meeting heavy, will work to fix this as it has meant a lot less time working with a physical output.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;(note to self - its ok to work on other things)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of meetings today, the first is the usual wider team where we share all of our plans for the week (and do a quick summary of the past week).&lt;br /&gt;
In the afternoon, running through a show-and-tell, held across all U.C. locations - Leeds, Manchester and London via SRS - Skype Room System (I learnt the meaning today, and then forgot it instantly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Played a part in a retro with all of Universal Credit‚Äôs design team, always interesting - hearing things we‚Äôd like to work on and realising there is a lot of cross-over from London to Leeds branches.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Facilitated an interview in the afternoon for an interaction design position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Worked on updating the prototype, heavily led from &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/08/07/weeknotes-no7.html&quot; title=&quot;my last months weeknotes no7&quot;&gt;last weeks UR&lt;/a&gt;, providing a simple ‚Äúnext steps‚Äù to aid the user is a quick and easy win to start the changes and to provide the user the feeling of being listened to!&lt;br /&gt;
To echo previous words - working to get ahead of sprints so we have time to test and change as often as needed without becoming a blocker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sat in a run-through of all the UR feedback of the past couple of weeks - plenty to work on, but also plenty of good things said by the users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Had a meeting with Head of Design (U.C) about supporting new starters, something I am passionate about and will focus more time on in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Half day catching up with emails, going through the amends for the DWP blog from the content team here, and arranging meetings to run through some minor amends to the prototype.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Afternoon spent using flexitime, taking the kid to Bridlington and spending vast sums on trying to win teddy bears!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;For your info - turns out Emma is incredible at winning things and I‚Äôm terrible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I‚Äôve said it before, but having flexitime is such a bonus working here. It allows my work and life balance to join up brilliantly and shows me this place is really a good for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Working amongst developers and QAs is such a great experience - I‚Äôve done this many many times (even being a developer), but seeing them discussing design and knowing that UX is a team-sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Meetings! Context switching is always tough, but will be working on doing less meetings and getting down to doing more of that design stuff (just to stress - this isn‚Äôt a normal week).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Even though, with all these meetings - it really feels now design is fully understood and valued, and the design team I work with should be so proud of what we have achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.7</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wednesday was an eye-opening experience (as most UR sessions are), which changed everything for me, and really had notched my passion to ‚Äúgetting things done right‚Äù to another level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Workshop session for roadmap planning - vision setting, goal driven and reminding the team what the point of the pilot is (not scale driven but whether we are doign it right).
Pre-planning meeting - design work tasks a plenty, what a difference working alongside the team makes! Lets go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
User testing a very early version of a ‚Äúcalc‚Äù, a very busy process to get to the end - will be reviewing my notes (whilst chatting to the user) and presenting back to the team what I believe needs to be done - in a cheap and timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;
And then run through again with the user and see what happens!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hopped on the train Chesterfield for another User Research session. This one was fascinating, one of my favourite ever URs. I even took a session (if you know me you‚Äôll know I don‚Äôt often!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think these tweets explain it more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Today was one of those days at work, where you know you are in the right place, for the right reasons and you have to do it for other people - the users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incredibly motivating, and the future feeling of satisfaction from succeeding will be HUGE.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mikey Cattell (@mikeycattell) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikeycattell/status/1156660728939589633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 31, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;After yesterday‚Äôs User Research (many will be impressed.. I did a sessionüòÇ), loads to unwrap today and get the message across. I‚Äôm very happy and motivated to do this for the users.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mikey Cattell (@mikeycattell) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikeycattell/status/1156832762684485633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 1, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The biggest difference (work wise) to other positions I‚Äôve worked in - today I won‚Äôt be giving feedback on the product, but the service. &lt;br /&gt;It‚Äôs taken me getting here to realise the product is such a small (but so valuable) detail, the service includes everything and everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mikey Cattell (@mikeycattell) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikeycattell/status/1156833178038034432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 1, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Splitting the two has allowed me to get more into ‚Äúwho is this going to touch‚Äù, not just those with computers, but (for example) workers, the strain of dealing face to face, time for calls, emotional support etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To fix this is a great task, but when it‚Äôs done - ooofff üî•üëåüëçüòç&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mikey Cattell (@mikeycattell) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikeycattell/status/1156833802456641537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 1, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Morning de-brief on the findings from yesterday, the team has escalated the findings and I‚Äôm excited for the team to fix these issues, and also grateful as I know the end-users will really appreciate the support and feeling of ‚Äúbeing heard‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprint planning, with showing value of design we know, have allocated slots of time to do content reviews, design amends, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Worked on planning the on-boarding pdf for new starters to the team.
Planning for an interview for next week (I‚Äôm the interviewer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Wednesday was the best / most interesting User Research session I‚Äôve ever been part of, and really showed the gap of ‚Äúwho is the user‚Äù, and why I do what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Back to Wednesday, it is always great to be reminded that I am part of designing a service, not just a product. This is why I joined, I wanted to design more than just things on a screen, and that is most certainly my role here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Back to Wednesday again, it was so tough seeing the users struggle with the ‚Äúunseen‚Äù part of the service, but knowing we will fix it is a good feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Leading on from last week, and my &lt;a href=&quot;https://michaelcattell.com/2019/08/04/having-a-wobble.html&quot; title=&quot;read my previous post about my wobble&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, this week was so different - having the team watch the users in action, and hear our feedback has changed the complete dynamic and I could not be more proud of this situation (and the team).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Having a wobble</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write this post so I may look back in a years time and see what has happened since and also share it to the so many that find themselves wobbling at work and worrying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a successful 3 years at Sky Bet, it was time to move on - due to one reason and another, and I found myself interviewing at DWP and (finally) returning to the one ultimate challenge that I vowed to return too. Coincidentally, its also been 3 years since I last worked at DWP, a lot of good work has happened in that time, there is much more of community vibe; people have got better (something that everyone should be proud of), mids become seniors - there also seems to be a lot more work to be done, which means the trust in us as a department is where we all dreamed it to be - 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve found the first couple of weeks exciting, challenging, tiring - I honestly couldn‚Äôt of asked for a more different culture, and at this point of my career its exactly what I want.‚Ä® I wanted a fresh challenge, something to push two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;posts&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;My skills as a designer - not just doing the pretty, but also providing an answer to designing services and using workshops and everything else that needs post its,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;(but more importantly) I wanted to work harder on my communication skills, the so called ‚Äúsoft skills‚Äù, the ability to get everyone bought into my/our design vision is the biggest test of all, it doesn‚Äôt matter where you are this should always be a thing we all strive for, and I wanted to get knee-deep into this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what‚Äôs this post about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The wobble.‚Ä®‚Ä® Why did I suffer from this? 
Was it people disliking my work? Nope. 
Was it my industry wasn‚Äôt valued by the wider team? Really no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a minor moment where design wasn‚Äôt discussed, more so, development was put as an important factor and how we can‚Äôt amend anything for a while on the front end, I sat in silence trying to not scream out ‚Äúwhat am I here for?‚Äù. I exited the meeting with a mood that could only compare to an album by Slipknot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds terrible, as designers with the mission ‚Äúto make things easier for the user‚Äù, it beat me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned the community earlier - I came out and straight away from this meeting, spoke to other designers in my team, sometimes having a calculated rant clears everything (coaching yourself or being coached is the best), and literally - in a flash the smoke cleared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good ‚Äúproper‚Äù people are amazing, and working with people you‚Äôd call friends is even better. This is DWP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots to fix? Not really, polishing up rough edges sounds more apt. Do I have support from my line manager and more? Heck yes. Will it be tough work? It better be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to start? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The difference from many places to here is, you are trusted for your skills - you have to use your initiative to get work, work doesn‚Äôt come to you via a ticket or a walk to your desk, we need to sell design, we ALL need to sell design, we need to get amongst the people and let them design and learn of its value. 
‚ÄúDesign in the open‚Äù isn‚Äôt just a poster - it‚Äôs a rule all designers should be doing from their first day, if you get paid to design you need to share everything - however little, however boring or however ‚Äúeveryone knows this anyways‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not personal, people do want to work with you - but in reality they don‚Äôt know what you do, they don‚Äôt get it, they don‚Äôt see value and why should they? Designers sometimes go for the big firework display presentation, writing or designing in the dark - who ever thought this was a good idea certainly hasn‚Äôt gone further than a Dribbble shot and spoken to a user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to instil the self-belief in others that it‚Äôs a team sport - we all fail, we all succeed. 
One of the best things said to me was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the designer, what ever you say is right* - and we‚Äôre fully behind you‚Äù&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We being the design team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm happy to lead by example and be the voice of change (I‚Äôve done it so many times before), but together we‚Äôll fix this to be in the design world we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Needless to say.. not EVERYTHING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.6</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week was my best week so far, loads of tasty work to get involved in, helping the on-boarding process for new starters (love working on people and relationships), and starting to present and showcase work-done is always a winner!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A really good catch up with the (wider) Leeds design team, as I got to know more positives and issues ‚Äì I voiced challenges to the team to get them thinking more about ‚Äúit‚Äôs not them‚Ä¶ but possibly the lack of education as a team when if/we share work etc‚Äù and the responses were incredibly welcoming and I cant wait to work more alongside them to see if we can do anything to make the design process smoother and a lot more well-known within the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sat alongside the content designer (Izzy), and we decided on an approach to tackle ‚Äúhow to get ahead of dev‚Äù in sprints ‚Äì this should lead us to getting our work seen and heard as early as possible (and as wide as possible) ‚Äì to avoid the current situation of working ‚Äúfrom-sketch-to-dev‚Äù without opportunity to stop, breathe and challenge (from everyone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Following on from &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/23/weeknotes-no5.html&quot; title=&quot;previous weeknotes no5&quot;&gt;last-week weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;, we revealed the first (early version) of a quickly-put-together PowerPoint presentation to showcase UR feedback. Incredibly useful, as the team has never heard the users voice, almost instantly led onto content amends - WINNER!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was a huge day for the team, the project they‚Äôve (I‚Äôve only joined so can‚Äôt claim any credit) sweated over for months/years went live! Such a proud moment for this squad, and we celebrated by doing a huge call with all the teams (Manchester, London) and raised a glass in unison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing to see the product in the open, working and seeing people work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Had a great meeting with the rest of Universal Credit‚Äôs design team, discussing ‚Äúways of working‚Äù, and volunteered to help on something I am very passionate about: ‚ÄúOnboarding for new starters‚Äù.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also, attended a leaving do, good to see the team celebrate her wins and a chance for me to know others outside of the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Quiet day in the office - starting to prep plans for ‚Äúonboarding new starters‚Äù, and running through the prototype with the team, with what I‚Äôve done so far (avoiding that firework display of just unleashing something and saying ‚Äúda-da‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Bundobust for lunch to celebrating launch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Again, helping others is what I‚Äôm really into, and to be asked (and recommended by others), mean the confirmation of what I bring to the team is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone in the team wants the project to be a huge success and going live showed that massively (and the celebrations to match!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Doing my expenses‚Ä¶ just joking(!) although the internal system is an incredible‚Ä¶ thing. Really, knowing where to start on things I am passionate about ‚Äì whether its starting on prototyping and getting within people to spreading the word of design to helping on-boarding new starters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Being asked to help, whether its for advice on sharing work to helping the design team move forward. Doing the day to day design work is great ‚Äì but going above that is even better!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.5</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A very interesting week personally, Thursday led to a wobble of confidence and self-questioning to a feeling of ‚Äúthis is why I am here‚Äù and a complete change of attitude to work and a fully focused version. This is the week where everything clicked - watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To kick start the week, we attended and took part in a user research session with the users in Harrogate, great to finally see the users getting their hands on the project. Loads to work on from the feedback (as normal), and excited to put it into action.
Interesting to see a high number of our assumptions actually become reality too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Early meeting with the design team (Leeds) to discuss how to show off our workings (namely UR findings), and planning tickets for sprint planning this week.
(Team) Decided on quick fixes for UI to allow the product to be ‚Äúeasier‚Äù to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Took me over an hour to get to work - after 20 minutes I could still see my bus stop from my seat - DOH!
Quick catch up with UR and content to confirm about design fixes for one of the projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sprint planning in the morning - ramping up to delivery!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the speed of delivery, design and content amends are to be slowed right down (stopped), in the mean time whilst we launch and leave for testing - I decided to build a prototype with the amends included for ease of show and tell to the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Took lead to plan design delivery going-forward with other designers (Content and UR), and scheduled a meeting Monday to start discussion with BA, PO and DM.
A need to get design involved into the team more, and decisions made in the open, we decided to start by sharing the findings from UR sessions to validate reasons why we must look at things and we have users!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Shared my &lt;a href=&quot;https://michaelcattell.com/2019/07/17/things-learned-in-first-month-atDWP.html&quot; title=&quot;a blog post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; I wrote about my first month in DWP&quot;&gt;‚ÄúThings I‚Äôve learned in my first month at DWP‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; blog post to an incredible response, really imprssed and happy with the support!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Something clicked this week, and I found my old self - a passionate designer who wants to include everyone in the journey and make design the fore-front, whilst challenging everyone and everything (including my own work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Dealing with a wobble is tough to get over, but it was a wobble that I needed. Having teammates who support you during this wobble and provide an ear to shout in is incredible and I‚Äôll forever appreciate things like this.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will be writing a post about this in the future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Planning, planning planning. I managed to plan my approach to assist in design decisions and it felt great, bringing alongside everyone else is the next mission (outside of the design team).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Things I‚Äôve learned in my first month at DWP</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On the bus home, I realised it‚Äôs been a month since my first day - a lot has happened in that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of anything ‚ÄúGov‚Äù related is to make things better, to be in the open and to (in my opinion this is key) work together as a team, all are an incredible ask to do and follow, but a challenge that everyone should be motivated to fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design team in Leeds consists of content designers, interaction designers, service designers and one of my favourite roles = user researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group this with BA‚Äôs, QA‚Äôs, Product Owners and many more - it‚Äôs a heck of a set up to get your head around, but 15 years working in this industry‚Ä¶ I can kind of guess what each role does, and if I don‚Äôt know, I always ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set up varies a lot from Sky Bet, for example, at Sky Bet, User Experience is labeled as a job title, a ‚Äúthing‚Äù exclusive to designers or Experience Architects, whereas here it‚Äôs seen as the responsibility of the team and should be vested in everything we do, and if not - someone will (quite rightly) shout out about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a huge difference is the size of the work/task - it‚Äôs often said that ‚Äúthe most important project of your life will be at DWP‚Äù, and 1 month in, I cannot disagree with this - the project I am part of, will affect many millions of people, be them people on the street, to civil servants to the country‚Äôs economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I enjoying it? It‚Äôs a question I‚Äôve asked myself a lot - it‚Äôs very different from my previous roles (removing previous DWP experience), a lot different. My career now is a lot less about the visual side of design and more about design theory, (dare I say the real ‚Äúmeat‚Äù of design (yes)?) it‚Äôs about designing the service as well as the product, which, at this point in my career is the reason I wanted to take this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also enjoy knowing the work I am doing is giving people hope, making their life better - this was a major reason why I joined the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges vary, but as everywhere else it boils down to how do people work together - everyone strives to succeed but how does that work in a team as big as 10-50 people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I noticed upon my first week here was the amount of intelligence that is in each meeting, this blew me away when I took a step back to listen to what people were saying and sharing their experience, this has validated my decision to join and really makes me want to up my game and share more about my (design) opinions whilst hopefully adding value to the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My motivations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squad based: are to work on relationships with stakeholders, work on designing-with-the-team and in the open (loudly), always improving communication skills and finding my place/niche/brand in the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the team(s) I am in, this will be easy to do-on-job as there is not a pressure to know the answers or deliver constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design team based: Focusing on my past experience at DWP and Sky Bet, the want to share and educate the value and need of design (and to just assist in understanding of what-we-do) seems to always be required and I am more than happy to help here - be it within a workshop setting or ‚Äúdoing-alongside‚Äù the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short - its an interesting and progressive environment, one where I am fully motivated to assist in and become a valued member of the community and overall team and to really help grow the brand of design and it‚Äôs value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about what I‚Äôm doing here, or if you are interested in joining the team - I‚Äôm available via twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikeycattell&quot; title=&quot;ask me on twitter&quot;&gt;@mikeycattell&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/contact.html&quot; title=&quot;get in touch&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.4</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A really good week where I felt my place was cemented in the team and finally had that ‚Äútada‚Äù moment of feeling really valuable and ‚Äúin‚Äù. Full of highs - including watching my daughter score a goal on Wednesday which led to daydreaming for the rest of the week for her to make the World Cup Final in 20 years time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Attended a huge team meeting, which spreads across Manchester, London and Leeds, using the biggest tv I‚Äôve ever seen, web cameras and other incredible technology things ‚Äì which was a little rocky at the start but was great to be part of and really gives the feeling of ‚Äúone team‚Äù.
Much nearer to home it‚Äôs our turn for a design team gathering, discussing the struggles of knowledge / awareness of job roles and how we can help (a struggle I‚Äôve seen many times in my career), I have plenty of ideas to help and will share in the next team meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Running through the current implementation and giving some UI tweaks and prepping for a content meeting.
Confirmation that we have sign off from No. 10 to launch!
Show and tell of a product we are launching very soon, group gave feedback and it was nice to all be talking in a nice environment.
Caught up with Gavin Elliott to discuss my first 4 weeks, great to talk and run through some of my own plans and to request a Surface Pro!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday / Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As I had flexi saved up - I took the morning off to watch Robyn‚Äôs first sports day (which was great), obviously I had to join in the parent‚Äôs race.
Afternoon - worked from home and answered emails and caught up with admin stuff (whilst starting to review one part of a project that‚Äôs on staging).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Show and tell in the hottest room of all time, attended some and soon departed due to the popularity of the item!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Catching up with the content designer and user researcher and ran through the product and found a couple of things we‚Äôd like to find out with them lovely users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roll on UR on Monday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Having flexitime is blinking brilliant and being able to actually use it is a huge plus point working here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Working together with the content design and user researcher was great ‚Äì a very good 2 hours of working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Seeing the design team having issues with ‚Äúwhat do designers do?‚Äù outside of the design-community, this ranges from content, UR as well as interaction designers. I have lived through this before, and will share my history of getting ‚Äúbuy in‚Äù from the wider team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Being the go-to person for design related questions happened this week in the team, and it felt great!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.3</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wednesday was a great day - to see all the hard work the team has put in and the users using the process they and we have all worked together on (and it appeared to work)!&lt;br /&gt;
Tough week saying goodbye to my old bud Si, but he‚Äôs left the team in such a strong state and will be forever appreciated, really great experience working with him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sat down with Sam and discussed the four versions of the ‚Äúcouples‚Äù prototype - upon reflection, we decided to narrow it down to three and make the journey a lot shorter to help manage the feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Had a session on ‚ÄúTeam Priorities‚Äù - seemed to make sense and saw more of the projects the team is working on.
Rest of the day - working alongside Sam in prep for showing the users the prototypes, writing scripts and confirming we haven‚Äôt lost our mind in routes.js (if you know.. you know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afternoon - meeting with Jo (the UR), to run through what we should and will run-through with the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With the team - attended an all day at Harrogate to work through with the users the complete system - from door to door.
Incredible to see such a complex and ‚Äúbig‚Äù service coming together and the actual users talking through how they will work and any issues they will have.
It‚Äôs great to just sit back, listen and see how comfortable they are with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Started to run through the ‚ÄúLive‚Äù service (on staging / QA), with Andy (content designer) and Sam (interaction designer) to catch any issues before launch.
Very healthy chat with the team on how we can tackle the next item on the list, a lot of people letting others talk, waiting their turn and having valuable chats about barriers and possible solutions (with a couple of unknowns thrown in to equal it all out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ermlikeyeah&quot; title=&quot;click here to see Si Wilson's twitter&quot;&gt;Simon‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; last day as a Service Designer on the team - its been a great pleasure working alongside Si for the past 3 weeks. I‚Äôve learned a ton in such a short time, from presenting his work/findings to managing a room during workshops.
I won‚Äôt need to wish Si good luck - his rep speaks for it‚Äôs self!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-Sprint planning in the afternoon, then home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ps. Loaded Fries from Fat Annie are killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Really enjoyed seeing how the teams hard work has lead to a service the users are happy and comfortable using, which is a credit to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I‚Äôve learned the trip to Harrogate is a heck of a nice journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Still having issues understanding the team set up, service and vast amount of acronyms; one day it‚Äôll click I‚Äôm sure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Working more with other people in the team helps me understand their roles and build relationships (all helped by aiming for people I don‚Äôt know in workshops and sitting with them), and also gives me opportunity to possible help educate my role back.&lt;/p&gt;
