        <title>Cheering the designer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This past year was the year I started teaching, it was the year I learned more about myself than ever before and it was a time I learned more about others and their situations, their cultures, and their problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spoken to people from Dubai, to San Francisco to Leeds and more and the lessons I’ve learned have been one of the best in my career and personally.
But this post isn’t about me, that’s for another time - what I wanted to share was my process of teaching and how I learned to talk to a room of designers and make everyone feel like they were the only one, or how I empowered them to feel at ease at feeling silly, asking that question without the preface “this is probably a silly question..” and feel confident in presenting work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I &lt;em&gt;cheered&lt;/em&gt; for the designer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started back in 2010, working in America - I was the lead designer of a company, and enjoying it - I had more work than I could handle, the work I was doing was interesting and helped companies and people provide a service. BUT I needed help, I was working on 3 companies all within a parent company - whilst they weren’t 100%, they needed some love and care.
This is where it all changed for me, my line manager came up with the idea of hiring 1-2 students to work alongside me, as well as promote internally a person to work as a junior designer, this would serve two purposes - one to help work “get done”, and secondary - it would grow my skill set managing and the students.
And it did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I learned more than I could write in one blog post within those three years, I worked hard on giving these new designers confidence, we would work together on understanding briefs, working out how to get more out of the stakeholders to allow us to replay the vision and problem back - we worked harder on presenting back our findings and early completed work to gain more of an insight into if we were going in the right direction (user research, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The one huge thing I did learn and have remembered from my own harsh experience is to never expose a designer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never call a designer (or anyone for that matter) out in front of the team, never ridicule, if the design or the presentation isn’t a smooth one, or a good one, as a design lead I must use this as a learning tool to help grow that missing skillset.
Exposing a designer in front of a crowd can lead to many things - loss of confidence, embarrassment, loss of the support of a colleague/team member, and with that a potential issue with the team environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, I have been exposed many times by self-titled design leaders, passing comments such as “No, don’t do that yet - you need to ask me first”, or “No, this isn’t any good, that’s not what we do here” or a personal favourite “What Mikey is trying to say but for some reason isn’t…” - I wish I had never experienced these moments, and I wish it never happened in public in front of my team, but to take these negatives and turn them into a positive is the only thing I can do and I will not allow anyone on my team to feel the way I did during those moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you stop exposing a designer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s pick a scenario, you are a design team manager, and one of your team is about to present their work back to the company - this, if it goes right makes your team look brilliant, makes the person look brilliant but also allows the design process to show its value.
The presentation goes bad, the person loses their way, rushes through and doesn’t mention anything about the process, and shows work off in a bad light - what do you do?
Calling them out would ruin their confidence to ever-present work again (which is in the top 3 skills I look for in a good designer), it would also cheapen the trust in the team - is there the possibility that you could ask questions that help open the conversation to allow the designer to “fill the gaps”, something along the lines of
“can you share more about the design process at the start of the project as I know you did some really good work with the team?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach will completely change your team’s ways of working, it will bring a different way of critiquing the teams and completely build trust amongst the wider business, it also allows you to take the designer aside (1:1’s) and help grow their skills privately, whether as a manager or (even better) as a leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more we empower other designers, the more they can pass it on and make our jobs a lot easier by making other designers around us better and feel more confident and safe to “just” design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.28</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The past week has been a great one - Robyn turned five, FIVE - how this happened is so crazy, it’s been an interesting journey being a father.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve learned so much from her, and my wife - learning to be patient, learning to coach my daughter to make her own way in life, giving her confidence, an opinion, and control… I’ve enjoyed it so much I’ve got a second one on the way! Keep an eye out for how tired I look in March…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This morning I was welcomed by 16 emails from over the weekend, all with deadlines - not the best way to start your Monday morning but it’s becoming a habit. I’ve learned to start working out what is actually urgent and more of panic by the person writing it, of which I then discuss this with them and it becomes a lot easier and clearer and calmer to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home update: the house has become good, really good - we have done a complete empty of every room (and trust me… when you have a 5-year-old running around who is a toy tester (don’t ask), a self-employed business (bobbin and bumble) and working from home full time it suddenly starts to add up.
BUT, we’ve done things over the past month to really make it homely again, and also ready for a baby in advance! Who’d of thought you can sort yourself out 3 months early and feel pretty ready for the baby?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Morning stand up, so glad I write notes from the day before to discuss as mornings as sometimes a rush due to doing the school run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, we discussed a change in our working process, co-working with another team - I always find discussions around things like this interesting and incredibly valuable learning tools, hearing opinions from developers, BA’s to PM’s. It’s an interesting time for our team, and having this external help from another team is invaluable to deliver something even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon meeting was brilliant - regrouping with Leeds based Interaction designers for a catch-up, really good chance to moan, cheer, and share work which I love doing!
A lot of us thrive on the communities we have, but also some slip through the gaps so it’s a timely reminder that often some designers do not have designers in their area of work due to (especially at current) the way it’s all set up. Time to support our colleagues and fix this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
School day (every day but Monday), I still wonder why the school sometimes insists on masks and social spacing in the morning, then other mornings don’t.
BUT I will say - Robyn’s school has been amazing, they have really changed Robyn in a good way, during lockdown she was fine and fun etc, but I know her learning was stalling - I can only do what I can do, but since school she now reads, writes, adds and now I know what to do from her telling me. Schools are possibly one of the most unappreciated and unspoken about heroes during this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we had an important ways of working meeting, I love these type of conversations as it leads to fixes but also airing of “why it doesnt feel so smooth” chats. We discussed design not getting in to the ticket early enough and why we need to be in these chats sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 After our ways of working chat, today was a new day, and starting to fix processes, we all attended the road mapping session. This is the first time I’ve seen the vision and future of the product I am on, whilst it looks heavy - it provides me with an overview of what’s coming, and also anything I can task myself or the design team with prep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate moment happened… I realised this team is missing an updated user journey map and we need one pretty sharpish as it’s getting out of control to keep track. In my true style of anti-gatekeeper, I’m going to start it all off using Mural and motivate and engage the team to keep it a living project to show off when/if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A strange day of catch-ups before everyone goes off on leave during Christmas time, on and off time to work but plenty of work to keep me busy during the week before the break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great way to end the week, a show and tell with the wider team of my “area of work”, with a huge show of thank you from those on the frontline of the “thing we’ve built”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well earned weekend again!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.27</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week might be the busiest week I’ve had ever at DWP, is it overwhelming, stressful, or a pleasurable workload? More than likely it’ll feel terrible in the moment, but incredibly positive in a week or two’s time due to “the thing I am doing”.
&lt;br /&gt;
It’s been an incredible couple of weeks, something I would not want to do again - but the outputs have been really good, some barriers on the way but what we have achieved in a short space of time has yet to be bettered in my career so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
BUT a huge highlight of the week is running a workshop for designers to assist in helping our communities come back together after a time of solo working and out-of-office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Started at 8:30, before meetings and requests come in to arrange and prioritise my workload for the day (and possibly week), early doors is meetings, meetings, and meetings!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My workload has ramped up over the past 3 weeks, due to holidays, people leaving, and just general needs for the country, it means a lot of context switching - but needs must at the moment, everyone s putting in a heck of a shift to make things better for people.
The afternoon was a run-through of a new project, it’s early doors but totally mind-blowing due to, again the context switching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Today is the day I finally plan the (interaction designers only) workshop to discuss if/why/what and how we make community meet ups better. Working remotely can give the risk of the design community the excuse to not “get together” at the risk of us all feeling silo, lonely, and possibly feeling like are not being supported by fellow colleagues - which isn’t the case at all, but sometimes it’s just good to vent to a person “who gets it”(!).
I am REALLY into aligning things as a design team, having a constant and similar vibe throughout the hubs, and the way we talk to each other is a good way to keep our values the same and also allow cross-team working and more importantly - sharing and learning.
I have no idea what the answer is, but working remotely isn’t as easy as you read - it’s a lot of hard work to get communication good, honest, and often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I decided against putting in a well-placed swear word in the deck, but… I cant promise this will always happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
First thing, stand up in the new team (I’m very popular at the moment - I’m collecting more teams than Robbie Keane - football reference FTW).
I hinted at it on Tuesday, but the context switching is tiring, it’s also exhausting and one thing I can take away and won’t ever do again (unless a must) when possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:1’s planned this afternoon, good to talk about progression, etc, and catching up with other designers - seeing how they are getting on and ready to be that ear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 The day I unleash a 30-40 workshop upon other designers in the wider team. Finding out about how valuable communities are, how we can (if needed) to improve them - PROPER excited as I love this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, huge day for one of my teams - first time a team outside of a certain location has commited a huge design change to a platform (sorry for talking in tongues… but ya know… somethings I cant talk about too much), it’s been a while to get work to this level - earning trust, respect and alignment but we are here and arrived to deliver something brilliant that will help A LOT of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Review of the workshop - went well, LOADS of great post its, really happy with how comfortable the team felt entering in their feelings, I hope I personally made them feel at ease.
Now to do the write up… who doesn’t love a deck?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Morning 1:1 with Gavin (Head of Design), who else can I spend serious time with to talk about gaming?
The rest of the day is to discuss some design changes to a team I’m working on (recently) about a very important project (possibly one of the most important one of my career) and updating a prototype that blows my mind (it’s not too complex, just been a heck of a lot of context switching and I think my brain is done for today).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bobbin and Bumble update:&lt;/strong&gt;
Friday evening is to discuss the launch of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bobbinandbumble.com/products/adjustable-ikea-highchair-footrest-bamboo-timber&quot; title=&quot;introducing bobbin and bumble's IKEA Highchair footrest&quot;&gt;wicked new product&lt;/a&gt; (that I can link now its live) for the IKEA highchair which helps your little one eat a lot better and be less wriggly - something I can promise you is a thing (hence the invention of the splash mat!).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.26</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I took a little time off doing weeknotes as it didn’t feel right sharing the work I was doing due to it being so fast, needed, and also so important right now for the country.&lt;br /&gt;
Since my last update, I’ve worked in multiple workshops, made many service views, enjoyed some challenges, hated some challenges, and felt overwhelmed with life in general.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s also worth noting that dealing with work demands, and family demands have also been a challenge - one that many has spoken about, and one &lt;a href=&quot;https://michaelcattell.com/2020/04/20/living-and-working-at-home.html&quot; title=&quot;my blog post on living and working at home&quot;&gt;I wrote about previously&lt;/a&gt; (to a lot of positive feedback too which I’m really grateful for).&lt;br /&gt;
I have also started to post to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/mikeycattell&quot; title=&quot;click here to see my dribbble account&quot;&gt;@dribbble&lt;/a&gt; with timeboxed design exercises to push my visual skills and also keep me fresh, on trends and to put any creative need to output in action!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the past couple of weeks, I’ve really deep-dived into the Service Design role which I’ve really enjoyed and found it really helpful to one team in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve also spent a lot of the last couple of weeks aligning the team to be User-centered and trying to remove barriers of discomfort not knowing the answer, it’s been a great challenge - helping me to really stretch my communication skills amongst many differing job-types and really selling the value of design and knowing it actually was effective is great feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first test of this was to educate to a team the value of design using a simple method I do that is along the lines of “process mapping”, so getting the team to split into two, getting them to “invent” the service journey from start to end - not a user journey but a service journey.&lt;br /&gt;
Along the way, they MUST write down who does this task, how they do this task, any risks, and what questions do we have about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output is always the same (so far) - the team on the same knowledge level, it’s a quick way to get the team co-design (and to show the value of co-design), and we have invented “discovery” backlog - the questions, the risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy peasy? Kinda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Realising my workload of recent times has been far too much, I decided to step down from a service team I was on (thankfully we have just hired an additional designer, so I managed to on-board him whilst working alongside him).&lt;br /&gt;
My last meeting with the team was to help direct them through their Discovery process - it’s a good feeling to know that people see you have a helper and (possible?) leader, we spoke through the point of discovery, what the (possible) point of their discovery is and what/how to deliver (thinking about presentations to stakeholders and what to share).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Today felt totally different, my workload has halved and my happiness, therefore, has doubled.&lt;br /&gt;
This means more time to think, more time to reply to emails and more time to mentor a couple of people within DWP that I’ve had to park for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But fortunately for them, I’m back with time - so they can expect plenty of direction!&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve even had time and motivation to write weekly notes again - finally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Back to my original (and in my opinion best obviously) team, working on decommissioning a service that we all worked hard to get up and running, but now it’s time to close it down due to completing its task. It’s been a great learning curve for the team to build it, and now to close it down is an even great one - thinking about all touchpoints, data storage, any user requirements and confirming the overall need to actually stop using the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working alongside one of my favourite PM’s means this is an easy task to run through, and I also get to dust down my interaction design chops - which I’ve left to go a little rusty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A quick catch up with the brilliant Content Designer whilst we discussing closing a service down, and how do we do it to actually help not hinder the end-user and inform them what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A presentation to one of the new starters about what we’ve been working on for the last year or so, and then early finish to go for a lovely walk with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/B_aRxcQpTiI/&quot; title=&quot;a link to my instagram account&quot;&gt;fluffy dog&lt;/a&gt; and chatterbox daughter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Something I’ve missed a lot of the past year has been line-management duties or mentoring consistently.&lt;br /&gt;
This is about to change as I was picked to be on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outofofficehours.com/may-2020/volunteers&quot;&gt;Out of office hours month of mentors&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m so excited to start. I’ve already got a lot of requests to help new starters to the industry and also people just feeling in a rut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Mentioned previously, it’s just been a good learning curve to know when to step back, give tasks to others, and realise I have other priorities. I feel a lot calmer now the rush of work needed has gone (for now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The lack of control at the moment of my own life and work has me in a spin. I had feelings of anxiety, anger, caged in, boredom, and just general stress.&lt;br /&gt;
The power of having GOOD people around you - whether to take work off you or people just having a normal conversation is brilliant and really not spoken about enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Feeling relieved my workload has halved and now I have time to think, to recover, and spend time with my family in the sun!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Living (and working) at home</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a post that’s been around my head for weeks, yet finding the motivation or even want to write it has been impossible.
I’ve wanted to record how I feel, how, as a family, we are handling this situation but not really wanting to face my own feelings.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m unsure why - those that know me I’m a very open book, happy to share my emotional state at a drop of a hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, here we are - many weeks after being made to work from home and I’ve finally found the want to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From memory, it was a Wednesday that we found out we were to stop working from the office and start to do the 9 to 5 shift from home, from my office - well a room that is too small to be anything but an office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started out being incredibly exciting, working from home, right? I’ve done this before, in fact, I had almost 3 years of it – but this was totally different, it was remote working, not WFH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out to be the complete opposite of what I’d experienced – I didn’t have an adventurous 4-year-old daughter, we didn’t have “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bobbinandbumble.com/&quot; title=&quot;visit the family run business Bobbin and Bumble&quot;&gt;a family business&lt;/a&gt;” to run which has gone from strength to strength and before Covid, it was hitting heights we couldn’t dream of and, well people love the products so we can definitely say we have been busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work has been tough to manage, it’s been meeting heavy – I’ve somehow morphed into a consultant for “how the design process should be done”, which is bloody amazing and something I’ve worked so hard on for the past 6 years, and noticed for this within a place like DWP is such a great thing, and to be noticed and recommended by other people is the best, but the challenge has been the meetings – video meetings have been a drain and quite a strain on sharing parental duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst, we are here, let’s talk about my daughter – without her silliness, without her energy, without her innocence in all of this I think I would have been overwhelmed by all of this, I am incredibly lucky to have “locked-down” with my child, and even at her worst, she makes me my absolute best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it turns out she has my sense of humour, she is as a crazy as I am with her impressions, her random animal noises and ability to really find humour in the silliest of things and bring light to the room – but try telling that to my wife as a 37 year old man is chasing a 4 year old around the house shouting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“ARRR IMMA MAKE YOU WALK DA PLANK LADY/LAD CATTELL”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with her on a horse and me riding a broomstick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just imagine living with that for a moment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a lot of conversations, supportive conversations with colleagues, friends, and my wife to help handle this pressure of having “spare time” that doesn’t really exist, the guilt of “home-schooling” and the general panic that spreads through a different schedule. Most find it tough to handle, I’ve struggled in the last couple of days and some have a situation that is tough to relate too, but being there is the most I can do for them and I know they feel supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUT:&lt;/strong&gt;
People telling me I should whip up another skill during this time, heck yeah let me learn to develop an app and read “the top 20 books all designers should read”, whilst teaching my child to spell her name using chalk, make dinner, walk the dog, shave my head and… oh shit yeah, do my day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back at this phase in our lives, I am sure we shall see a time of change, a change of pace, a change of priorities, a time of panic, a time of valuing the importance of having good friends, a good family and the need to support others and ourselves through hurdles that appear out of no-where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all the darkness, I’ve found myself closer to friends, I’ve found a chance to refocus, I’ve found out I REALLY love helping and mentoring others, my family is as close as it’s ever been, I’ve been reminded that my wife is a &lt;em&gt;fucking superstar&lt;/em&gt; - not only is she running a business but she’s also running the house and enabling my child to be an absolute rockstar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been rough, it’s been annoying, it’s been safe for us all, it’s also been insightful and I’m actually thankful that I can learn something from what is a sad, terrible experience for us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay safe, it’s ok to be overwhelmed and it’s also ok to struggle or thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What to look for in a mentor</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen and read a lot recently about needing a mentor, the value of being a mentee and who you should use and look up to and I just wanted to share the framework I lean toward every time I’ve mentored with the hope it might help you pick the best mentor for you, and get the most out of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What a mentor should be:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mentor comes in many guises, it can be someone in your industry, but it also can be someone who is totally on the outside, some of the best experiences I’ve had have been totally opposite to what I do, as a designer and being paired up with someone from accounting sounds a disaster but it worked so well and also assisted in myself being clear about my job duties and where I wanted to go outside of the design bubble.&lt;br /&gt;
They should be someone who you can trust, you are going to share incredible secrets to them, you will share worries, dreams and issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Do they need to be incredibly successful and have a track record of being brilliant?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
No. And I have to stress this, the most incredible mentors aren’t the best in their industry, they are the best enablers, they are the best supporters, they are empathetic, they are intelligent (emotionally) and also great communicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What should you expect from a mentor?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the above helping you whittle down the many offers, what do you actually get from a mentor?&lt;br /&gt;
Time: I try to offer an hour every 2 weeks, it doesn’t sound a lot but with structure this is more than enough (I haven’t included random check-ins and quick Q &amp;amp; A sessions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What support will I get?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This varies, but I think a good mentor should give you what you need, tailored support. Sometimes a lot is needed, other times it’s just a coaching process - stay silent as much as possible and I promise you the solution will talk it’s-self to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;
The big one is support that never stops, whether you need a mentor for 6 weeks, or 6months - you should expect support from now to when you really don’t need it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mentor or friend?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Do you want someone who will support you as a friend or someone who will give it to you honestly?
Personally, I try to aim for the middle - someone who will find all your worries and wants, but also handout a dab of honestly if/when needed, but in truth we all know what’s holding us back most of the time and it comes out early conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will you talk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
How will you communicate, is it over Skype, slack, WhatsApp, trello or smoke signals? The choice is endless, but finding this out early is key to keeping the comms flowing, I tend to go for slack for work chats (and growing a community vibe by using “channels” to allow the mentees support each other, trello to track work/convos and talking points (one private for notes that I’ve made and possible solutions, one shared with person for notes that we both can discuss and work/tasks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a Framework!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have started using a mentor and it feels a little lapse, try to arrange a framework on tasks. Remember, it’s mostly one way, it’s on the mentee to keep going, the mentor should prod and check in for updates but won’t chase for things to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned it above but here is what to expect from me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The first meeting is key, using something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gavinelliott.co.uk/2020/01/lets-start-from-the-beginning/&quot; title=&quot;Read Gavin's blog post Lets start from the beginning&quot;&gt;Gavin’s post as a starter&lt;/a&gt; means the conversation is all about you - a deeper understanding is key for us to know and work together (this isnt an interview),&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Arrange a catch up (at least) for approx 1 hour every 2 weeks,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Regular quick checks (WhatsApp/slack to see if any blockers),&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use Trello to list the to do’s so we both know what our aims are, and what the weeks tasks are,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don’t overwhelm both parties - a lot of “free” work isn’t fun, whatever the prize is, so go slowly and use motivation to your advantage,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If we need a starting point - I have tasks I’ve set in the past in a library I have on Trello, so there is never a “we have nothing to do” moment,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I set a reminder at the end of every month, where we review two CVs, your current one and your future one - what have we done and we do we need to do (this has proved to be so popular and effective),&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I use job listings that catch your eye (if known) and we see what they say to fuel the skills we need, or the tools we use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Passing it on:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you’ve had a brilliant experience being mentored, and if not that works too, why don’t you try passing it on - mentor someone and help someone who needs support, it’s one of the most fulfilling things I’ve done in my 17 years and will continued to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;And finally...&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentored many in the past, and still check in on them now (some from over 8 years ago), I’m open at the moment for adding one or two to the team, if anything above sounds like it would help you - let me know with a &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hello@michaelcattell.com?subject=Mentor blog post&quot;&gt;simple email&lt;/a&gt; and we can chat more. With any initial contact, there is no pressure on the first contact, so it can be as short or indepth as you’d like. It’s a huge step we are both taking, so removing the big hurdle and just pressing send is the start, I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.25</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I found really tough, we found a situation (it’s not an issue… just an interesting development) that was pretty major to users, but was overlooked due to miscommunication. This really made me reassess our (design) process and something I did take personally, but also worth noting that once we realised, we quickly pivoted to explore, address and “fix”, calling in outside teams with experience and similar learnings.&lt;br /&gt;
Huge takeaway from this week: talk more, talk amongst your colleagues and do regular catch-ups with similar products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Presented for 40 minutes today which was fun to do, would have liked to have a little more time to prepare for it but to think on my feet is a nice feeling to have - so I can learn from it and do it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;
Presenting the work I’ve done so far on this project, some great feedback from the presentation - especially around “setting the scene”, and also an education to assume not everyone knew what I was talking about (but I thought they did), so that’s huge learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My team’s retro today, a great 30-minute session to really find the issues, the positives, and the fixes. I love a good retro, its a place where we can celebrate and fix anything that has proved to be difficult over the past 2 weeks. The ease at which this team will discuss struggles and issues is a positive, even if it is very negative - we strive together to be the best we can be and to fix/swarm around any issues.&lt;br /&gt;
The joys of a tight team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was a day of 2 emotions,&lt;br /&gt;
The good: I mentor a colleague in the team and I couldn’t be more proud of her when she ran a user-stories workshop.&lt;br /&gt;
In this project, it was noticed we were short of user-stories, so we swarmed around to fix this, gaining knowledge from experts and those on “the shop front”, I also stress this is the kind of knowledge we should be sharing and knowing from previous working products and forever will bang this drum.&lt;br /&gt;
The bad: Within this workshop, something came out that got me interested, a process that wasn’t planned or discussed and was overlooked, I picked this up (design instinct and experience!) and the team realised that we NEED to review this section and urgently.&lt;br /&gt;
Since this day, we have reviewed and put a plan in place, but this shows that every team requires a designer (of sorts) and a need and opportunity to call things out as soon as you feel things aren’t right.&lt;br /&gt;
We did this, we are in the process of fixing this, and it will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Important meetings today discussing future plans of design tasks (wider team) which took up most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bobbin and Bumble update:&lt;/strong&gt;
Digging through the tons of data that Emma has accrued on her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/bobbinandbumblebaby&quot; title=&quot;visit Bobbin and Bumble on etsy&quot;&gt;Etsy shop&lt;/a&gt; to improve, change and also fuel updates on a website which is miles behind the actual reality of her shop.&lt;br /&gt;
Quite a drastic update is required as the photos, products are not working the best for the website, but Google rankings are working, as we are getting regular traffic to the site (and sales), which is interesting considering the amount of effort we have done with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another update required: Emma needs to update her LinkedIn account… so keep an eye out for this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Discussed the issues found from the Workshop on Tuesday, a good team meeting and a lot of fears were calmed (if any), a lot of actions to take and learnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
WFH day, a well earned out of office day that was needed to get headspace in reviewing what happened within the 2 weeks since returning from New York.&lt;br /&gt;
Managed to work a lot on the Service View of the product, working closely with other teams to try to get a “joined-up design” view and learn as much as possible when its “free knowledge”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Seeing the team swarm around problems is what co-design is all about, we saw the issue, and worked to fix it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Remembering that the design view of the project doesn’t fail and revolve around me is a great learning and a timely reminder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Finding out we missed a step was something I struggled to get over and I did find myself getting frustrated. It’s been a testing week, but hopefully one we can learn from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Two weeks in a row I’m proud of someone I’m helping to find their feet and more importantly - their confidence. They did so well, they made the room “work hard” and “team-up” on an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.24</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s good to be back, having that week off has meant I have come back fully rested (enough as you possibly could be walking 30k each day in New York), but this also means the teams I work with have had to endure questions about everything, from things they’ve done to everything I’ve done.&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes/always its good to take that time out to reevaluate everything done, especially as this project is one of the most important ones in the country (and incredibly.. topical).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The snow has arrived and totally broken my bus, meaning its a WFH day.&lt;br /&gt;
This gives me time to catch up and arrange (more) meetings to see how some-very-important-meetings went during my week off, I never fear anything with this team though!&lt;br /&gt;
A couple of heavy meetings today, running through priorities for this “period of work/year”, which is important in building direction and togetherness, sharing our issues and seeing if we can put them to the front of the queue to “fix”.&lt;br /&gt;
But first…. stand-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bobbin and Bumble update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Emma is now working from a regular daily to-do list, which is helping her manage her workload and anxiety of having tons to do, she is attending and has a stall at MamaMeets in York, so there is a lot to get ready before then - designing, planning and sorting out the things I would forget (like how to take money from a card..) and finally.. update all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/bobbinandbumblebaby&quot; title=&quot;see bobbin and bumble's products&quot;&gt;products&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Back, amongst the people physically after a week and a bit away. Loads has been done and done so well.&lt;br /&gt;
A catch up about a Workshop I missed last week, discussing the outcomes and review of the Service Map with the external partner and today is just meetings and catch-ups and supporting colleagues in 1:1s and performance review write-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the Service Map and some minor parts of the process after a week off has been interesting, a lot more questions (new ones) and challenges to feed back to the team - showing and reminding me of the power of having that time “out” to help work on the return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:1 meeting after a while, good to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in the evening I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://michaelcattell.com/2020/02/25/giving-the-power-back.html&quot; title=&quot;read my blog post about giving the power back&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about “giving the power back”, it is something that I often remind people in the design industry and something I am quite passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Design is complex, but we’ve made design a mystery, where there is no mystery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://michaelcattell.com/2020/02/25/giving-the-power-back.html&quot; title=&quot;read my blog post about giving the power back&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; and let me know your thoughts&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Wider Interaction meeting in the morning - working with differing locations means technology is stretched, but this morning we got lucky and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;
I presented, sharing an introduction into the “new” team I’ve joined, the purpose and goals of the team, my role, how I ran the co-design workshop and finally whats next. &lt;br /&gt;
I also asked a question about working together - content and interaction and how to make it an easier ride (was a general question, the content designer I work with is ace, a little mad but ace).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of content, I ran her through the process map and purpose of the team as shes newly joined (the team not DWP), and sold the dream, as expected and loved - she asked 105 questions and within 20 minutes provided vast value by just questioning things. 
Working in a safe environment works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter part of the day - working on user needs, this is often something that can be misused as (business) assumption led and often “desire to understand”. 
Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I was approached by a colleague to mentor them, which is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 First meeting with my new mentee - enjoyed getting to know her, she’s really interesting and motivated to learn as much as possible. 
This is where I asked one question and then listened, listened as much as possible to her sharing her journey, her wants and where she’d like to be in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared my thoughts on the user needs, swaying the team away from thinking user requirements as the same as user needs, and there is a plan for a workshop for a “proper” session. I am also mentoring another person in the team, she will be leading the workshop, which I am incredibly excited to see how she will do (which will be incredible).
We have discussed the goals, purpose and outputs required from the workshop, this will help the team hugely during the discovery phase, get us back on track and allow us to find “the truth” in all needs and requirements to shape and size against the current MVP process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also worth a mention was the design community meet up which happens weekly, hosted by the new Lead Content Designer - Sir &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Andy_D_Long&quot; title=&quot;check out Andy Long on twitter&quot;&gt;Andy Long&lt;/a&gt;. I have long supported Andy, and I couldn’t be happier knowing he’s at the helm of content designers and I can see his skillset, influence and management skills a great fit for DWP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great meeting discussing accessibility with another great - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CaleiSmith&quot; title=&quot;check out Calei on twitter&quot;&gt;Calei Smith&lt;/a&gt;, another one who got a well deserved promotion.&lt;br /&gt; Loads of GOOD opinions, in a totally safe environment with all levels and differing job types representing.&lt;br /&gt;
More of this please, in fact, loads more of this, please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Half day flexi - yessss!&lt;br /&gt;
First thing, helping out a colleague with a CSS fix - it was around moving one prototype to another, quickly. I have to stress this often to many who get stuck - a prototype is never production level (and if it is.. you aren’t doing it right), so I just bodged it to the highest level of a pure bodge. It worked the first time and I didn’t know what to do with the rest of the meeting.. nothing ever works first time! It’s really great that people come to me now, asking for help, support and advice - I feel incredibly valued and I also know I can provide help and support, but more importantly they know if I don’t know the answer I will go get it and don’t mind looking stupid finding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had a meeting with all Senior Designers within DWP, this is my first since joining (technology escapes me so much..), I loved this, knowing most of the people in the meeting meant I could crack the odd joke whilst updating the team on my progress, issues and get updates of their progress too. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Obviously, knowing this… I opened up with “all right fam”. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good week, loads done, loads to chew over and LOADS of co-designing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Returning back to find the team has upped themselves and really covered a lot of ground in a week and totally smashed it. It’s an interesting time, and it can also be incredibly testing on morale, but we seem to really support each other and that has to be more important than any output at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;
I know the workload will eventually be too much, but the feeling of working out of my comfort zone is really pushing me to learn more and it feels a good place for my career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As ever, taking that step back and looking from the outside makes things so much clearer.&lt;br /&gt;
Working with Emma means I can’t just say “oh you should do this” when I don’t have the bigger picture AND I’m not on the “shop floor”. This is a move which I’ve seen a lot and it is a terrible habit to get into and claim to be a hero. &lt;br /&gt;
Judging before having the full picture is something I need to learn, will learn and will keep reminding myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Finding my pace, the pace of the team always changes and I have struggled this week with jetlag, finding the latest update and also trying to pull the team back from running away with “progress”.&lt;br /&gt; 
I think it’s important to review where we are, and where we are heading instead of going silo just to get things done. I did disagree with somethings that were done, and upon me explaining my views they did too - we quickly realised, and will now quickly fix with a workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Having a “cold” email from a colleague whom I have spoken to once before, asking if I could mentor her. Word of mouth and recommendations has led her to myself, which I’m incredibly proud of and I really do enjoy mentoring.&lt;br /&gt;
She has incredible potential, and I’m excited to help her to move forward in her career (if possible) and let her grow however she wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Giving the power back</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I sat in a meeting, in fact I’ve sat in many meetings where it’s been said 
“Right, that’s decided.. and you’ll design that later” and I’ve been ok with it, I did design it later and it did succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gained the figures they needed, it ticked the boxes and I delivered something good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something good, but not something great.
It answered the “now” problem, it did what they needed, it answered the issues for the next 3 months but a year later it was outdated and not fit for purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So I did well, what’s the problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t answer the problem, it was the thing I see so often - “the conveyer belt of design”, it was passed down and I was expected to deliver the creative juice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see this happen so many times, private and public services - a designer holds a key to the mystery box of design and that approach, has put us in this space that we don’t want to be in.
We disappear into that “yes” job, not early enough to say no, not early enough to do creative thinking or worse - miss the product strategy conversations and that key co-design sessions are what makes a product and team tick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design is complex, but we’ve made design a mystery, where there is no mystery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is a team sport, UX is everyone’s job, no one wants to deliver a bad service or experience - along the way there a lot of gatekeepers, and design is one of them, but to be a silo key holder is anti co-design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening the room gives you more voices, more choices, more opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is scary for most designers, some are precious about design, some are just scared if feedback, some think non-designers should be designing, whether it’s a service map, or wireframes or even straight to hi-res mocks, we need to give back, we need to allow others in, and in return we must be involved in other disciplines. 
Imagine sharing the burden and weight of designing something special, a clear brief, clear boundaries and impressively no one questioning your design when/if you insist on the big firework”show and tell” presentation of your majestic work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rolling back to my example, I remember it like yesterday, it’s a reminder tool that I use often when telling the price of co-design, I also know a certain PM I worked with who will also share this terrible tale of silo work which lead to nothing, a shot, a stamp of a pretty visual but not much substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what did we change next time I can imagine you shouting at the screen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked, we spent time together to find the real problem, the real thing THEY - the user, the stakeholder wanted - a problem / opportunity statement. We ran workshops, we planned roadmaps, we got brains in a room and made such brilliant magic we enabled a dream to become reality and that is when REAL design happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communicating with the team was the best gift I gave myself, sharing the pressure of delivering design freed and still frees me of any constraints and limits of my own ability. I am the best designer in the room (best being - I’m the paid designer, it’s officially my job), no one can challenge that, BUT I’m not the most knowledgable of the problem, and that is something to keep remembering - you aren’t handing over your job keys, you are opening your job and delivering something that is better, and that is most certainly going to be nearer to the solution quicker than I could possibly deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I challenge you to include as many into your process as possible and see what happens, remove the secretive cycle and allow others to pick up a pen and scribble, they might just surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Celebrating the wins</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself - when did you last celebrate a win?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean your favourite sports team winning, I don’t mean when you decide you’re having a takeaway tonight, I mean when you’ve achieved something, maybe when your squad/team has launched something or when a loved one achieved something special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past couple of years, I’ve noticed a trend, it’s pretty daunting – I don’t see or hear the wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since working alongside my wife - assisting in the web/marketing content of both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/bobbinandbumblebaby&quot; title=&quot;check bobbin and bumble's shop on etsy&quot;&gt;Etsy shop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/bobbinandbumblebaby&quot; title=&quot;check bobbin and bumble's website&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, before I got near any work I had to dig into my personal rule book and set some rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we joined forces, Emma was aiming for the stars, she wanted success - she’s been doing this since 2015 and she has been very successful - since 2015 (December to be exact), she has run her own company, been a full time mother - she has somehow managed to do all of this in the same 24 hours that I went to work, came home, put my daughter to bed and moan I didn’t have time to watch football.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds great doesn’t it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really, now our daughter is at school Emma wants more success, she wants her products to rush off the electronic shelves and be sold out in hours instead of days or weeks.
This disappointment could lead to days of un-motivation, lack of great ideas or worse - closing the company down and giving in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what did we change? What difference could we make to this process, to the business and to her and my success?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We simply made some rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made goals&lt;br /&gt;
We spelled out the wins&lt;br /&gt;
We called out the failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we do? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agreeing on mini goals:&lt;br /&gt;
It’s worth reminding yourself - setting goals, especially big goals is all about getting what we want, but if we set goals that are too large we are talking about the far future - you do need to set these, but sometimes you can loose heart if you do not achieve these quickly. Smaller goals, mini goals are easier to set, quicker to land and even better - quicker to learn from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting goals is great, it helps set out the landscape - expectations, direction and the truth.&lt;br /&gt;
To set goals you need to think about: launch day, 1st week, 2nd week, 1 month, 3 months to 6 months and so on. What do you want to achieve in those?&lt;br /&gt;
Emma and I decided on setting goals for just the launch, 1st week and 1 month - that way we could quickly change direction if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch was the toughest to set - during this process I had to share my learnings and best ways of working - these included being as simple as possible, using the RAG rating system (a personal favourite) and just being open about what we want to achieve or find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s as basic as (not in any order):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;agree on logo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set launch date&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;research competitors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finalise designs and export&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;discuss with the manufacturer about processing designs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;update all social media accounts with new branding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used Google sheets so we both could access and amend, this helped Emma keep focus, and work through a list at speed - whilst waiting on one thing she could action the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t discuss too much on how to set goals (that’s potentially another post), but I also set goals to start a habit, like “post to Instagram every day”, “research keywords for &lt;em&gt;insert product&lt;/em&gt; - 1 product per week”, “spend an hour per week reviewing stats on Etsy and website” and finally “celebrate your first sale with a treat!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate the wins:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeding on from the goals we set - we needed to celebrate the wins, Emma has never done this before (where as I celebrate everything, as I know the knock-on effect of it) - every “done” was a moment, a huge moment for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when she sent her first order to the manufacturer, we celebrated with a meal, this meant a lot of things, it meant she had signed off her designs, she trusted someone with her designs, she was ready to start selling. It didn’t need to be as big as this, but just something to announce “you did this, and you did it well”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I make sure the team celebrates the good, and sometimes the bad. I tend to call out the winners during Retros (however good a Retro is, I don’t always use this to announce people who did good things as its also a moment where we are saying what went wrong with a time limit), so maybe it can be during a stand-up, or the answer to “has anyone got anything else to add?” in another meeting - either way its nice to call someone out and let them know we have noticed their effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dream big and get those small wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could write this down on everyone’s desk and remind them of this every hour I would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since working with Emma, and doing a lot of back-ground hunting, researching and digging into the data I could get my hands on - I’ve realised that success is not linked to good luck - obviously that can play a part in it, but it’s a lot down to the effort and how well you allocate time - working out what are the quick wins, the big wins and the expensive possible-might-work are key to a successful launch and first couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s always a learning curve, but having your work planned out with value and then celebrating when completion of the bigger or tricky items has led to keeping us motivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, be kind to yourself when you are working - notice when you have a win and celebrate yourself, small wins are all part of the plan for the “big” win.&lt;/p&gt;
