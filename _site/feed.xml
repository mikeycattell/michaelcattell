        <title>Weeknotes No.25</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I found really tough, we found a situation (it’s not an issue… just an interesting development) that was pretty major to users, but was overlooked due to miscommunication. This really made me reassess our (design) process and something I did take personally, but also worth noting that once we realised, we quickly pivoted to explore, address and “fix”, calling in outside teams with experience and similar learnings.&lt;br /&gt;
Huge takeaway from this week: talk more, talk amongst your colleagues and do regular catch-ups with similar products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Presented for 40 minutes today which was fun to do, would have liked to have a little more time to prepare for it but to think on my feet is a nice feeling to have - so I can learn from it and do it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;
Presenting the work I’ve done so far on this project, some great feedback from the presentation - especially around “setting the scene”, and also an education to assume not everyone knew what I was talking about (but I thought they did), so that’s huge learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My team’s retro today, a great 30-minute session to really find the issues, the positives, and the fixes. I love a good retro, its a place where we can celebrate and fix anything that has proved to be difficult over the past 2 weeks. The ease at which this team will discuss struggles and issues is a positive, even if it is very negative - we strive together to be the best we can be and to fix/swarm around any issues.&lt;br /&gt;
The joys of a tight team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was a day of 2 emotions,&lt;br /&gt;
The good: I mentor a colleague in the team and I couldn’t be more proud of her when she ran a user-stories workshop.&lt;br /&gt;
In this project, it was noticed we were short of user-stories, so we swarmed around to fix this, gaining knowledge from experts and those on “the shop front”, I also stress this is the kind of knowledge we should be sharing and knowing from previous working products and forever will bang this drum.&lt;br /&gt;
The bad: Within this workshop, something came out that got me interested, a process that wasn’t planned or discussed and was overlooked, I picked this up (design instinct and experience!) and the team realised that we NEED to review this section and urgently.&lt;br /&gt;
Since this day, we have reviewed and put a plan in place, but this shows that every team requires a designer (of sorts) and a need and opportunity to call things out as soon as you feel things aren’t right.&lt;br /&gt;
We did this, we are in the process of fixing this, and it will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Important meetings today discussing future plans of design tasks (wider team) which took up most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bobbin and Bumble update:&lt;/strong&gt;
Digging through the tons of data that Emma has accrued on her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/bobbinandbumblebaby&quot; title=&quot;visit Bobbin and Bumble on etsy&quot;&gt;Etsy shop&lt;/a&gt; to improve, change and also fuel updates on a website which is miles behind the actual reality of her shop.&lt;br /&gt;
Quite a drastic update is required as the photos, products are not working the best for the website, but Google rankings are working, as we are getting regular traffic to the site (and sales), which is interesting considering the amount of effort we have done with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another update required: Emma needs to update her LinkedIn account… so keep an eye out for this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Discussed the issues found from the Workshop on Tuesday, a good team meeting and a lot of fears were calmed (if any), a lot of actions to take and learnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
WFH day, a well earned out of office day that was needed to get headspace in reviewing what happened within the 2 weeks since returning from New York.&lt;br /&gt;
Managed to work a lot on the Service View of the product, working closely with other teams to try to get a “joined-up design” view and learn as much as possible when its “free knowledge”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Seeing the team swarm around problems is what co-design is all about, we saw the issue, and worked to fix it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Remembering that the design view of the project doesn’t fail and revolve around me is a great learning and a timely reminder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Finding out we missed a step was something I struggled to get over and I did find myself getting frustrated. It’s been a testing week, but hopefully one we can learn from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Two weeks in a row I’m proud of someone I’m helping to find their feet and more importantly - their confidence. They did so well, they made the room “work hard” and “team-up” on an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.24</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s good to be back, having that week off has meant I have come back fully rested (enough as you possibly could be walking 30k each day in New York), but this also means the teams I work with have had to endure questions about everything, from things they’ve done to everything I’ve done.&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes/always its good to take that time out to reevaluate everything done, especially as this project is one of the most important ones in the country (and incredibly.. topical).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The snow has arrived and totally broken my bus, meaning its a WFH day.&lt;br /&gt;
This gives me time to catch up and arrange (more) meetings to see how some-very-important-meetings went during my week off, I never fear anything with this team though!&lt;br /&gt;
A couple of heavy meetings today, running through priorities for this “period of work/year”, which is important in building direction and togetherness, sharing our issues and seeing if we can put them to the front of the queue to “fix”.&lt;br /&gt;
But first…. stand-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bobbin and Bumble update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Emma is now working from a regular daily to-do list, which is helping her manage her workload and anxiety of having tons to do, she is attending and has a stall at MamaMeets in York, so there is a lot to get ready before then - designing, planning and sorting out the things I would forget (like how to take money from a card..) and finally.. update all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/bobbinandbumblebaby&quot; title=&quot;see bobbin and bumble's products&quot;&gt;products&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Back, amongst the people physically after a week and a bit away. Loads has been done and done so well.&lt;br /&gt;
A catch up about a Workshop I missed last week, discussing the outcomes and review of the Service Map with the external partner and today is just meetings and catch-ups and supporting colleagues in 1:1s and performance review write-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the Service Map and some minor parts of the process after a week off has been interesting, a lot more questions (new ones) and challenges to feed back to the team - showing and reminding me of the power of having that time “out” to help work on the return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:1 meeting after a while, good to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in the evening I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://michaelcattell.com/2020/02/25/giving-the-power-back.html&quot; title=&quot;read my blog post about giving the power back&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about “giving the power back”, it is something that I often remind people in the design industry and something I am quite passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Design is complex, but we’ve made design a mystery, where there is no mystery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://michaelcattell.com/2020/02/25/giving-the-power-back.html&quot; title=&quot;read my blog post about giving the power back&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; and let me know your thoughts&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Wider Interaction meeting in the morning - working with differing locations means technology is stretched, but this morning we got lucky and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;
I presented, sharing an introduction into the “new” team I’ve joined, the purpose and goals of the team, my role, how I ran the co-design workshop and finally whats next. &lt;br /&gt;
I also asked a question about working together - content and interaction and how to make it an easier ride (was a general question, the content designer I work with is ace, a little mad but ace).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of content, I ran her through the process map and purpose of the team as shes newly joined (the team not DWP), and sold the dream, as expected and loved - she asked 105 questions and within 20 minutes provided vast value by just questioning things. 
Working in a safe environment works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter part of the day - working on user needs, this is often something that can be misused as (business) assumption led and often “desire to understand”. 
Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I was approached by a colleague to mentor them, which is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 First meeting with my new mentee - enjoyed getting to know her, she’s really interesting and motivated to learn as much as possible. 
This is where I asked one question and then listened, listened as much as possible to her sharing her journey, her wants and where she’d like to be in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared my thoughts on the user needs, swaying the team away from thinking user requirements as the same as user needs, and there is a plan for a workshop for a “proper” session. I am also mentoring another person in the team, she will be leading the workshop, which I am incredibly excited to see how she will do (which will be incredible).
We have discussed the goals, purpose and outputs required from the workshop, this will help the team hugely during the discovery phase, get us back on track and allow us to find “the truth” in all needs and requirements to shape and size against the current MVP process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also worth a mention was the design community meet up which happens weekly, hosted by the new Lead Content Designer - Sir &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Andy_D_Long&quot; title=&quot;check out Andy Long on twitter&quot;&gt;Andy Long&lt;/a&gt;. I have long supported Andy, and I couldn’t be happier knowing he’s at the helm of content designers and I can see his skillset, influence and management skills a great fit for DWP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great meeting discussing accessibility with another great - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CaleiSmith&quot; title=&quot;check out Calei on twitter&quot;&gt;Calei Smith&lt;/a&gt;, another one who got a well deserved promotion.&lt;br /&gt; Loads of GOOD opinions, in a totally safe environment with all levels and differing job types representing.&lt;br /&gt;
More of this please, in fact, loads more of this, please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Half day flexi - yessss!&lt;br /&gt;
First thing, helping out a colleague with a CSS fix - it was around moving one prototype to another, quickly. I have to stress this often to many who get stuck - a prototype is never production level (and if it is.. you aren’t doing it right), so I just bodged it to the highest level of a pure bodge. It worked the first time and I didn’t know what to do with the rest of the meeting.. nothing ever works first time! It’s really great that people come to me now, asking for help, support and advice - I feel incredibly valued and I also know I can provide help and support, but more importantly they know if I don’t know the answer I will go get it and don’t mind looking stupid finding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had a meeting with all Senior Designers within DWP, this is my first since joining (technology escapes me so much..), I loved this, knowing most of the people in the meeting meant I could crack the odd joke whilst updating the team on my progress, issues and get updates of their progress too. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Obviously, knowing this… I opened up with “all right fam”. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good week, loads done, loads to chew over and LOADS of co-designing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Returning back to find the team has upped themselves and really covered a lot of ground in a week and totally smashed it. It’s an interesting time, and it can also be incredibly testing on morale, but we seem to really support each other and that has to be more important than any output at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;
I know the workload will eventually be too much, but the feeling of working out of my comfort zone is really pushing me to learn more and it feels a good place for my career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As ever, taking that step back and looking from the outside makes things so much clearer.&lt;br /&gt;
Working with Emma means I can’t just say “oh you should do this” when I don’t have the bigger picture AND I’m not on the “shop floor”. This is a move which I’ve seen a lot and it is a terrible habit to get into and claim to be a hero. &lt;br /&gt;
Judging before having the full picture is something I need to learn, will learn and will keep reminding myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Finding my pace, the pace of the team always changes and I have struggled this week with jetlag, finding the latest update and also trying to pull the team back from running away with “progress”.&lt;br /&gt; 
I think it’s important to review where we are, and where we are heading instead of going silo just to get things done. I did disagree with somethings that were done, and upon me explaining my views they did too - we quickly realised, and will now quickly fix with a workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Having a “cold” email from a colleague whom I have spoken to once before, asking if I could mentor her. Word of mouth and recommendations has led her to myself, which I’m incredibly proud of and I really do enjoy mentoring.&lt;br /&gt;
She has incredible potential, and I’m excited to help her to move forward in her career (if possible) and let her grow however she wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Giving the power back</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I sat in a meeting, in fact I’ve sat in many meetings where it’s been said 
“Right, that’s decided.. and you’ll design that later” and I’ve been ok with it, I did design it later and it did succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gained the figures they needed, it ticked the boxes and I delivered something good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something good, but not something great.
It answered the “now” problem, it did what they needed, it answered the issues for the next 3 months but a year later it was outdated and not fit for purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So I did well, what’s the problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t answer the problem, it was the thing I see so often - “the conveyer belt of design”, it was passed down and I was expected to deliver the creative juice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see this happen so many times, private and public services - a designer holds a key to the mystery box of design and that approach, has put us in this space that we don’t want to be in.
We disappear into that “yes” job, not early enough to say no, not early enough to do creative thinking or worse - miss the product strategy conversations and that key co-design sessions are what makes a product and team tick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design is complex, but we’ve made design a mystery, where there is no mystery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is a team sport, UX is everyone’s job, no one wants to deliver a bad service or experience - along the way there a lot of gatekeepers, and design is one of them, but to be a silo key holder is anti co-design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening the room gives you more voices, more choices, more opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is scary for most designers, some are precious about design, some are just scared if feedback, some think non-designers should be designing, whether it’s a service map, or wireframes or even straight to hi-res mocks, we need to give back, we need to allow others in, and in return we must be involved in other disciplines. 
Imagine sharing the burden and weight of designing something special, a clear brief, clear boundaries and impressively no one questioning your design when/if you insist on the big firework”show and tell” presentation of your majestic work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rolling back to my example, I remember it like yesterday, it’s a reminder tool that I use often when telling the price of co-design, I also know a certain PM I worked with who will also share this terrible tale of silo work which lead to nothing, a shot, a stamp of a pretty visual but not much substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what did we change next time I can imagine you shouting at the screen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked, we spent time together to find the real problem, the real thing THEY - the user, the stakeholder wanted - a problem / opportunity statement. We ran workshops, we planned roadmaps, we got brains in a room and made such brilliant magic we enabled a dream to become reality and that is when REAL design happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communicating with the team was the best gift I gave myself, sharing the pressure of delivering design freed and still frees me of any constraints and limits of my own ability. I am the best designer in the room (best being - I’m the paid designer, it’s officially my job), no one can challenge that, BUT I’m not the most knowledgable of the problem, and that is something to keep remembering - you aren’t handing over your job keys, you are opening your job and delivering something that is better, and that is most certainly going to be nearer to the solution quicker than I could possibly deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I challenge you to include as many into your process as possible and see what happens, remove the secretive cycle and allow others to pick up a pen and scribble, they might just surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Celebrating the wins</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself - when did you last celebrate a win?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean your favourite sports team winning, I don’t mean when you decide you’re having a takeaway tonight, I mean when you’ve achieved something, maybe when your squad/team has launched something or when a loved one achieved something special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past couple of years, I’ve noticed a trend, it’s pretty daunting – I don’t see or hear the wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since working alongside my wife - assisting in the web/marketing content of both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/bobbinandbumblebaby&quot; title=&quot;check bobbin and bumble's shop on etsy&quot;&gt;Etsy shop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/bobbinandbumblebaby&quot; title=&quot;check bobbin and bumble's website&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, before I got near any work I had to dig into my personal rule book and set some rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we joined forces, Emma was aiming for the stars, she wanted success - she’s been doing this since 2015 and she has been very successful - since 2015 (December to be exact), she has run her own company, been a full time mother - she has somehow managed to do all of this in the same 24 hours that I went to work, came home, put my daughter to bed and moan I didn’t have time to watch football.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds great doesn’t it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really, now our daughter is at school Emma wants more success, she wants her products to rush off the electronic shelves and be sold out in hours instead of days or weeks.
This disappointment could lead to days of un-motivation, lack of great ideas or worse - closing the company down and giving in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what did we change? What difference could we make to this process, to the business and to her and my success?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We simply made some rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made goals&lt;br /&gt;
We spelled out the wins&lt;br /&gt;
We called out the failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we do? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agreeing on mini goals:&lt;br /&gt;
It’s worth reminding yourself - setting goals, especially big goals is all about getting what we want, but if we set goals that are too large we are talking about the far future - you do need to set these, but sometimes you can loose heart if you do not achieve these quickly. Smaller goals, mini goals are easier to set, quicker to land and even better - quicker to learn from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting goals is great, it helps set out the landscape - expectations, direction and the truth.&lt;br /&gt;
To set goals you need to think about: launch day, 1st week, 2nd week, 1 month, 3 months to 6 months and so on. What do you want to achieve in those?&lt;br /&gt;
Emma and I decided on setting goals for just the launch, 1st week and 1 month - that way we could quickly change direction if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch was the toughest to set - during this process I had to share my learnings and best ways of working - these included being as simple as possible, using the RAG rating system (a personal favourite) and just being open about what we want to achieve or find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s as basic as (not in any order):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;agree on logo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set launch date&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;research competitors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finalise designs and export&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;discuss with the manufacturer about processing designs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;update all social media accounts with new branding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used Google sheets so we both could access and amend, this helped Emma keep focus, and work through a list at speed - whilst waiting on one thing she could action the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t discuss too much on how to set goals (that’s potentially another post), but I also set goals to start a habit, like “post to Instagram every day”, “research keywords for &lt;em&gt;insert product&lt;/em&gt; - 1 product per week”, “spend an hour per week reviewing stats on Etsy and website” and finally “celebrate your first sale with a treat!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate the wins:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeding on from the goals we set - we needed to celebrate the wins, Emma has never done this before (where as I celebrate everything, as I know the knock-on effect of it) - every “done” was a moment, a huge moment for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when she sent her first order to the manufacturer, we celebrated with a meal, this meant a lot of things, it meant she had signed off her designs, she trusted someone with her designs, she was ready to start selling. It didn’t need to be as big as this, but just something to announce “you did this, and you did it well”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I make sure the team celebrates the good, and sometimes the bad. I tend to call out the winners during Retros (however good a Retro is, I don’t always use this to announce people who did good things as its also a moment where we are saying what went wrong with a time limit), so maybe it can be during a stand-up, or the answer to “has anyone got anything else to add?” in another meeting - either way its nice to call someone out and let them know we have noticed their effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dream big and get those small wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could write this down on everyone’s desk and remind them of this every hour I would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since working with Emma, and doing a lot of back-ground hunting, researching and digging into the data I could get my hands on - I’ve realised that success is not linked to good luck - obviously that can play a part in it, but it’s a lot down to the effort and how well you allocate time - working out what are the quick wins, the big wins and the expensive possible-might-work are key to a successful launch and first couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s always a learning curve, but having your work planned out with value and then celebrating when completion of the bigger or tricky items has led to keeping us motivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, be kind to yourself when you are working - notice when you have a win and celebrate yourself, small wins are all part of the plan for the “big” win.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.23</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Phew - a mad old week with loads to learn.
The highlight has to be the brilliant New Adventures Conference, it was really THAT good.
I will now go every year, some amazing life and career changing talks that really made me think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A confirmation that our “Service journey” was as correct as it can be up to the point of actually “doing it” with the team who have done a similar service in the past. Really exciting session and always nice to know, as a team we are so far doing so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Meetings, stand-ups and planning is what Mondays are all about.
Drew up the outcomes from the workshop on a massive whitewall to present tomorrow and Wednesday to stakeholders with the BA, led to more questions and more collaboration with the wider team which is my aim of design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Workshop all day. Can’t say much more due to the nature of it - sorry!
Bobbin and Bumble news.. i’ve started to dabble into re-designing her site as in coding.. its like 2015 all over again where I use to go knee deep in e-commerce themes (Wordpress, Magento to name a few) - weirdly I bloody loved it and have much more work to go, but it folded back like a bad dream - even remembered how to use Liquid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Today was busy.
Had a run through the workshop results with a team working on a similar thing I modelled my project on due to its successes, its research and the goals but most importantly its lessons learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, they agreed it was similar and a really interesting show and share session.&lt;br /&gt;
The morning was Roadmap planning - imagine having a roadmap workshop and it being fun? It was - so healthy disagreements (the good type.. yes there is a good type) where, if I disagreed with a “thing” I was asked to elaborate on it and was heard. Some of my points weren’t agreed with, but being listened to and their points back were enough for me to go “yeh.. you were right and bloody very much right!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 The day I’ve been looking forward to for a while, New Adventures Conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, this was one of the best conferences I’ve ever been too. It was so “up my street”,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two talks that “got me” were &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/akilbenjamin&quot; title=&quot;follow akil on twitter&quot;&gt;@akilbenjamin&lt;/a&gt;’s talk “Clean your studio. Draw on walls. Don’t break things. Radical is close to home.” was a really close-to-home talk.&lt;br /&gt;
From the opening, where Akil discussed personal things, breaking down choices is something I went through last year. This approach has totally changed my view on things, and how I approach certain decision points etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second talk was by the incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elizejackson&quot; title=&quot;follow liz on twitter&quot;&gt;@elizejackson&lt;/a&gt; called “Productivity recreates disability”.&lt;br /&gt;
This talk had me in a spin. Never ever has a talk made me question it all, and been such a “shit let’s change this” moment. I want to thank Liz for that talk, as it will completely change everything, my approach to design and my approach to “thinking about others”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to rewatch it all, tough to concentrate and remember when you’re nodding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also as a bonus, I got to spend the day with designers from DWP, which is always great to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A day to plan out next week, it’s been a busy couple of weeks and I used today to do admin. List down what I need to do, what I wish to do and what I can do to make it easier for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really good day to calm any work-load fears, the PM of the team has offered so much support than is great and I’m a huge supporter of offering help as much as possible and reminding others to not overload - in this case it was up to someone else to remind me as I totally didn’t respect my own limits.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.22</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;An incredible week following on from last weeks’ stunner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the thing I prepped for last week and it went brilliantly. I managed to overcome past nerves of presenting (who’d of thought prepping in adv would remove nerves?) and the outcomes were wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;
Really loving the teams I am in at the moment, both give me space to learn and grow and provide me with the trust of my own skillset again (I never lost this inner belief, but its nice to be reminded by others).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Today is the start of a crazy week at work - a 3-day workshop!&lt;br /&gt;
I’m using today to write up the deck and prompt cards to present the design task on Wednesday and to help out on other parts of the workshop.&lt;br /&gt;
Planning the agenda, outputs, things needed and just hanging with a blinking great team.&lt;br /&gt;
If you guys ever read this - this team is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really looking forward to playing a big part in this workshop, it takes me back to my Sky Bet days where I would lead design tasks, either planning out a service/process map or getting into the actual design of a page (crazy 8s etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in the evening, we started to work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bobbinandbumble.com/&quot; title=&quot;visit bobbin and bumble's website&quot;&gt;Bobbin and Bumble’s&lt;/a&gt; new look website.. it needs a little bit of attention and, as I have the odd year or two experience..I’m gonna do it and not rely on using templates that are not really “doing” what we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Today is the start of the workshop.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s been in planning for a while, and as a team, we were nervous, excited and prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoiler - we didn’t need to be, it was brilliant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important job of the first day is to get everyone up to speed, whilst working in a friendly environment - accepting all questions, approaches, and opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outline of the day is as follows (some is missing due to.. well I can’t share THAT much):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Introductions:&lt;br /&gt;
Round table introduction of each person - name, title, duration on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scene Setting:&lt;br /&gt;
Why we are here, what we stand for etc&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ice Breaker:&lt;br /&gt;
10-15 min exercise to help the room get to know each other and get talking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our agenda and hopeful outcomes. An interactive ‘What do we want to achieve out of the workshops’:&lt;br /&gt;
Get the room to write on post its - what do they want out of the workshop, then break it down to day one, two and three (make sure you educate the room on the outline of each day without too much info).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where we are and how we got there:&lt;br /&gt;
Discuss whats gone on before, and where we are (confirming the problem statement etc).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agile Ways of Working:&lt;br /&gt;
Run through ways of working with the team, who does what and how we might run sprints, or handovers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hypotheses for Design:&lt;br /&gt;
Exersise to work out what do we wish to test after the design task. Tricky to do, so set the room up with examples, or educational piece.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Review and wrap up of day:&lt;br /&gt;
Lightly touch on what happened throughout the day, run through “day 1” post its and confirm we delivered or missed out on certain needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The day I get to run the “Design task” to the group - this is my first one ran at DWP, so I am a little nervous, but thankfully and a huge thank you to “Voice in the room” (public speaking training), I knew to prep and how to say it - I have run many workshops before, but this one felt like one of my best.&lt;br /&gt;
I had planned out the introduction to the problem/opportunity and then stressed how safe we are as a room (we as a team had bonded enough by then), what we want to achieve at the end, the task, ran through the outcomes then bring it back to see if we did what we needed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2’s outline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reflection:&lt;br /&gt;
Speak through what we did yesterday and the day’s plan&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ice Breaker:&lt;br /&gt;
Another ice breaker to get the room moving&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lessons Learnt:&lt;br /&gt;
What have we learned on previous projects that are similar (if any) using out-side-the-team presenters (U.R etc)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hypothesis Review (including dot voting):&lt;br /&gt;
Run through yesterday’s Hypothesis session, after a nights sleep there were questions to ask and different hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design task:&lt;br /&gt;
As mentioned above, it was all leading to this magical moment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;
Confirm we did what we needed to do, and any outstanding questions before leading into the last day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 The final day of the workshop - thankfully, I could sleep for a month!
Today is just a catch up, review and confirm we delivered everything we needed and everyone is ok with where we got as a team and to confirm the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the easiest day of the week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A very chilled day, I worked through trying to read my notes and coming up with questions to ask from these notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retro in the afternoon and then a well deserved weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bobbin and Bumble update:&lt;br /&gt;
Since joining Emma as a consultant, we’ve managed (as a team) to up traffic and sales quite quickly within 3 months using a multitude of experiences and new learnings.&lt;br /&gt;
Combining her tone-of-voice and personality with SEO techniques, good design practice, general housekeeping, and goal setting - we’ve managed to run a tighter, more focused business approach and so far it has turned out to generate an amazing reaction from amazing customers and supporters.&lt;br /&gt;
I knew her products were good and desirable, it was just about getting it out there better, getting it to the audience clearer and making sure it was presented consistently.&lt;br /&gt;
And also not looking behind at people copying her style of products and presentation of products but looking ahead and seeing what the market is doing and wanting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rant alert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One thing that did rile me and has made me more dedicated to making this a success was the amount of envy and attacks from the competition (not all, some have been so supportive and cheer-leading). I have never experienced this in my career, I’ve had people copy my work, even present my work in interviews as their own (Jet2 to name a famous one whilst at Sky Bet), but never call me out or even go to the level of bullying tactics.&lt;br /&gt;
We should be supporting each other, there is enough business out there for all and if you are threatened by a competitor then it’s says more about your own trust in products than someone else’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I can’t stress how great the teams are that I work on, we really are hitting form and the support and trust of each other is so amazing, and inspiring. We cheer and celebrate everything together, and if needed we swarm around a problem and help out. It’s all about helping and learning, not blaming and pointing, and I love that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I learned more about my own wants and direction in my career - I want to do service design things, I want to work with people and I want to support. This has been the busiest week for a long time, and I’m sure it’ll get busier, but it’s incredibly enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Work-load is creeping to a huge amount, I will call this out next week and know it’ll be sorted out as soon as I mention it, it’s always worth knowing when you feel the work-creep and let as many people know as possible, you are no good if you are producing low-end work and feeling rubbish. The team doesn’t want this, and more importantly - you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We did it! As a team we delivered a brilliant workshop, together and totally smashed it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.21</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s great to be back in the thick of things.&lt;br /&gt;
What started out to be a slow and tough week (some things annoyed me somewhat), ended up being my best week in DWP as of yet.&lt;br /&gt;
I did things, things I’m good at and things I enjoy doing. I planned a workshop, I worked with a team that pushed me far and I delivered.&lt;br /&gt;
I also get to use past experiences to deliver something that (hopefully) will be an effective use of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
First day properly back in the office since 2019 (yikes), and I can officially say I had no idea what is happening!&lt;br /&gt;
It took a while as expected to get the wheels in motion, which was a good job as we are planning a 3-day workshop for next week, and its plenty of work!  This is a new team I have entered since my last notes and it’s in a Service Design role, and its vastly different to my normal day to day role, but it feels nearer to what I think I do best (so far).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my other (original) team, the team is in prep for Discovery, this month is going to be super busy for me - but support is there and will be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using today to just catch up, build relationships and try to remember what happened last year and work out where we are going in the teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Early doors meeting to listen to the team that did the project (that we are entering Discovery) before us - they were quite far in it but due to other requirements needed to pause their discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer, I had 105 questions in regards to direction, blockers, frustrations and any opportunities we might have since they have done the project and what the original problem statement was. All in all, it was a great meeting and one, the team fully enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared learning and all that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in the afternoon was a session with Andy to run through a possible “new starters” kit. I love working on things that will make a new starters’ life a lot easier and calmer, I know from previous experience when starting new roles that on-boarding can make a job great, and bad onboarding can make you feel a little undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Today was the best day. I have recently been asked to step into a Service Design role for one of the teams and today, again I got to see if the shoe fits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So far.. so good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels a natural move as Service Design seems to cover a lot of what Interaction Design doesn’t for me, but again its early doors and I haven’t found any struggles (but the team is great on supporting me as I’ve spelled it out there will be more wrongs than rights with my technique to start with).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did a whiteboard session planning out the 3-day workshop, we are working with an external partner and we want the days to be totally useful for all. Being the designer of the group and thanks to Sky Bet especially, I have been led a lot of Workshops in the past and provided my tips. &lt;br /&gt;
We set goals, requirements, attendees, agenda, problem/purpose of the day etc - setting these out assisted in planning out the rest of the days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day ended with going home and finishing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://michaelcattell.com/2020/01/09/weeknotes-no20-the-2019-review.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; and working on updating my work page on my site, it is missing a lot of work I’m proud of, so expect an update soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Coffee, earphones, planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the day I write notes at 100mph - learning as much as possible from phone calls, face to face meetings and asking questions that are pre-planned or off the cuff. I warn everyone pre-meeting that I like to ask questions, and in all honesty, I’ve never faced any issue with this approach as everyone always wants to share their wins, fails and knowledge - knowing it will do the product well as it is passed down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had another whiteboard session to map out the “design task” of the workshop, a lot easier when working with someone from Policy / BA to find the ins-and-outs of the rules, must-haves that we need to include in the users-journey. End of day meeting, we discussed how the workshop will run - the full team is doing a part of each day which is great, hardly any pressure on anyone and sharing the work means we can chip in if anyone has a wobble or gets asked a question they aren’t sure of. &lt;br /&gt;
I shared my Design plan - the rules, task, intro, and timings and it seemed to make sense, if you have ever done a workshop with me previously you’ll know I don’t run a design task “tight”, I allow for a lot of changes and let the room dictate how it could be run - I don’t let it run wild but I also shy away from leading the process or worse.. doing design bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Early doors Workshop - this one I’m participating in, not running (grateful for this fact!). It’s a session to work out the service’s initial vision and roadmap. A great session, loads of information sharing, fact-finding, and good outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day is finalising the “deck” for the design-task for next week!
Busy busy week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As mentioned in the opening paragraph, this week was great. It started with my feeling a little dejected due to resource issues, workload and a feeling of aimlessness. &lt;br /&gt;
Then Wednesday happened, I was doing what I had done so well for the past couple of years - sharing, telling, showing, learning and listening to a great team. I led meetings, I listened to meetings and we ended up with a really healthy result - &lt;strong&gt;that is team work. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I know the workload will eventually be too much, but the feeling of working out of my comfort zone is really pushing me to learn more and it feels a good place for my career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I was asked last year to step into a Service Design role and accepted the challenge as I have always wondered what the role was, I still haven’t quite found out but so far it feels like something I would love. I’m unsure if I am actually doing it - but whatever it is I’m learning a lot and working a lot more open with members of the wider team, which is always great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This week was full of them, the feeling I had on Monday-Tuesday was not great. I’m unsure what instigated it, but I also know it’s more on myself to set the vision for myself, find my own goals and work out what or how I want to gain them. &lt;br /&gt;
Also, Emma’s back went wonky again - so managing her work, her health and our daughter is always a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The stuff I learned working through Discovery is more than I could possibly write - sharing work, stepping back, facilitating meetings, allowing others to lead parts of a workshops and many many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More weeks like this are certainly ordered from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.20 - the 2019 review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I last wrote, I used Purdah as a chance to recharge my batteries, read over my past notes and see where I was, where I am and where I wish to go and do a 2019 review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a wild year, (spoiler alert) over the year my daughter turned 4, my wife upped her business to another level, we had an election and I changed jobs and the big one - I GOT A NEW KITCHEN!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
At the start of 2019, I started to feel a little lost in my career - feeling “itchy feet” is a strange feeling when you are happy and content, but I felt I wanted to offer more and do more, more than I was currently offering.&lt;br /&gt;
Personally, I felt I was not giving 100% to the job, which I had done so much for, I had run at the job at 100mph giving 100% and really wanted to make a change to the design culture there, learning as much as possible from an incredible manager and sharing even more, looking back at my time at Sky Bet, I did achieved this and would not change a thing, and I feel really proud of my time there, the output of work by the team led to a lot of accolades (getting to number 1 in the App downloads for Sky Sports Super 6 game, gaining more players for Sky Sports Fantasy Football and working on relationships with stakeholders are things I am really proud of).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a note - anyone who is thinking of joining and working at Sky Bet, I recommend the experience and can confirm you will learn so much there and the people are really top notch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, I decided to leave Sky Bet to move to a place I was very familiar with - DWP (Department for Work and Pensions), citing a change of career direction and to really push my skillset to the limit. I knew the potential of someone like myself working there, and felt if I take everything from Sky Bet to here I could really make a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow my weeknotes, you’ll know I found the change of culture and work very tough to dive into, it is a total change of pace - whereas at Sky Bet you work fast and change things at speed, at DWP you need to plan, you need to research, and you need to talk to a much bigger audience (be them stakeholders or users). THIS is the challenge I have always wanted, I want to manage workloads, I want to influence people, I want to present in front of a room that is full of the most intelligent heads in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time, I have also changed how I design - I care a lot less about the aesthetic and more about content, the why and how someone will use the page (not in this order). I care about the research (I always have), I care about the cost, and I care about the end user and the end result and more importantly - I care about the service we are putting out, is it the right service?, can it be better?, should we be doing the service? and 1005 other questions, which I am more than happy to voice and challenge with the knowledge that this is a safe approach and the teams I work in not only expect this of me, they welcome it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bobbin and Bumble launch:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This year my wife Emma proudly re-launched her company with new branding and a new name.
Gone is xMimiMakes and welcome &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bobbinandbumble.com/&quot; title=&quot;click here to visit my wife's website Bobbin and Bumble&quot;&gt;Bobbin and Bumble&lt;/a&gt;, this turned out to be more work than we expected due to relaunching the Instagram account (starting from 0), updating and making new sales points (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/bobbinandbumblebaby&quot; title=&quot;visit bobbin and bumble on etsy&quot;&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bobbinandbumble.com/&quot; title=&quot;click here to visit my wife's website Bobbin and Bumble&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;), and finding manufacturers that would do what Emma needed them to do, and when she needed them to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tough stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was also alongside teaching Emma how to use design software, which was actually really easy as she has the ability to just “keep going” on her own and working it out herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daughter Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Watching my daughter grow up into a strong independent person who has her own ideas, sayings and jokes whilst being so eager to learn and listen has been a journey I was not expecting, but one I’ve enjoyed a lot - she has reminded me to be more open about being creative (reading books in silly voices or emphasising certain words actually helped me do more public speaking for example), and obviously she had made my life a hell of a lot more fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 brought on our first parent’s evening - which she did so well on and was labelled a “role-model” to the younger children coming in as she takes care of them, she did her first play (she was a donkey!), she rode her first bike, she reminded me how much she hates football, she still doesn’t know what I do for a job (but neither does her mother), and her favourite film of 2019 was “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5117670/&quot; title=&quot;link to peter rabbit film on IMDB&quot;&gt;Peter Rabbit&lt;/a&gt; AND it was the first year she knew properly what Christmas is, and got overly excited on Christmas eve (demanding she goes to sleep as soon as possible before Santa finds her awake).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s in store for 2020?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The past 6 months, I have felt very different about my career - my duties changed and the ways of working changed.&lt;br /&gt;
Whereas before, it more user-conversion led and quite an one-directional approach (idea-research-design-launch-next), I am now working in a more “Service Design” role and leaving the side of design that I fell out of love with and this new role feels a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to talk more, share more and work with a lot of differing roles to spread ways-of-working efficiently and effectively - using past techniques that have worked, I also want to know what can we, designers do better to help make relationships and working a lot easier and smoother for all.&lt;br /&gt;
I want to empower designers to make decisions, hard decisions and call out things when they are wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
I want to feel valued, I want design to feel valued and I want people to know enough about design as they can do without feeling overwhelmed or undervalued themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I do this in a year? Maybe, maybe not - but what better place to do it that here, with the support of many I am going to give it a good go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal level, the election was a tricky time - due to the services I am currently working on I got to see some of the people directly affected by past and current voting, which in turn did affect me in a way I didn’t expect, but I do believe those that are working on these services are the best and as a team, we will do a great job - it might be a struggle, we might lose people on the way but we will succeed and we will make a great difference to a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all in all an interesting year compared to 2018 – I’ve learned and changed a lot, seen my family grow and seen a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed your 2019, and if not – let’s make 2020 the best one, however sometimes tough that might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, 2020 I want to get back into giving back, so please feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;/contact.html&quot; title=&quot;get in touch&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;, I have a successful past in mentoring many different people, all at differing stages of their career - be it a total fresh start to wanting advice on becoming more senior.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.19</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A wonky week of WFH and in the office.&lt;br /&gt;
Having your house smashed to bits is not how to prepare for a relaxing Christmas, but hopefully it’ll run so smoothly I wont even realise I’m filing the kettle up from the bathroom tap, washing up in the shower and having sandwiches for each dinner. Barely noticable..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plus points was Monday - worked so well with the wider team, having a U.R. touch point for help, and he’s been great - so helpful.
Working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/robynandmimi/&quot; title=&quot;my wifes instagram account - Robyn and Mimi&quot;&gt;Emma&lt;/a&gt; has been a huge highlight as well, I’ve shared all I know about managing projects, building emails to writing (hopefully) interesting posts, reminds me of the old days of contracting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Catch ups as normal at work with the wider design team.
Also, working alongside a User Researcher for advice, its been an interesting learning experience working without a User Researcher in the team and filling in the gaps.
Doing a discussion guide, finding out assumptions/questions, getting the team to see what they class as possible issues look for trends in the pile of issues that the users have sent in (using Jira as a base to post these issues to).
I’ve enjoyed this, always great to learn more when possible and the level of support received from the team and business in this resource shortage has been good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, my evenings are taken up working on Emma’s business website - &lt;a href=&quot;http://bobbinandbumble.com&quot; title=&quot;click here to see bobbin and bumble&quot;&gt;Bobbin and Bumble&lt;/a&gt;, reworking the site to v2 to add more content to the home page, it’s been an interesting journey getting the site live, we’ve had minor issues along the way - which, back in my contracting days I would have caught instantly.. but the rust is showing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
WFH - builders are in!&lt;br /&gt;
Anxiety is on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of loud terrible noises, and pure panic from myself. Ahh - who’s idea was this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finalising the discussion guide in preparation for tomorrow’s run through with the content designer.&lt;br /&gt;
Day of doing the admin jobs, as it’s nice and quiet.. well its nice.. well i’m at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another WFH day, quiet days like this are perfect for learning - which means for me… reading up on discovery processes from pages such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works&quot; title=&quot;gov.uk discovery guide&quot;&gt;Gov.UK Discovery guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been quite a while since I was part of the early days of a project (4 years), so it’s great to have a refresher and to share my findings with the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Morning stand up, as I’ve been out of the office for two days these are useful so I know what others are up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick chat through on the UR plans for visiting and conducting interviews, and then confirming the discussion guide - just a date and location to decide on now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the project is nearer an end - I’m looking forward to the health check that I have needed to instigate, hopefully it shows everything is running as smoothly as hoped, but also to let them feel listened to and do any fixes that need doing instantly to the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workload has lightened up, allowing me to work on the “community” things that DWP does so well. Speaking to other team members, seeing what I can take from my previous experience working with other design teams and share and just “be in the same room and listen” to how the team is functioning and check for any patterns.&lt;br /&gt;
This is the stuff I love doing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Somehow.. the team is all WFH (including me) - so a morning chat on Slack is needed. You can tell this team is a healthy pack of friends and colleagues by the fact we take turns when talking, wait for the conversation to end, and comment. And proudly - if there is a problem we all swarm around and help, if needed we down tools and assist. It might be one of the friendliest and most helpful teams i’ve ever worked in. It’s amazing and a real joy to spend my working hours with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are soon to go into Discovery, and I’ve given myself the task of lining up some meetings with colleagues who have gone through the discovery “adventure” before, and see what they are doing, done and find out how they found the whys and do the hows and to share to the team the findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sharing issues with London and Manchester shows that as a team - we can really work well together. In our time of need (we are under-resourced in User Researchers at the moment), we could call upon one and he instantly offered his help and understood our situation. He may not be able to do “field work” (being onsite to speak to users), but he can and is assisting us in doing it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Great to work outside of work, and remind myself I can launch a product. Working with my wife on &lt;a href=&quot;http://bobbinandbumble.com&quot; title=&quot;click here to see bobbin and bumble&quot;&gt;Bobbin and Bumble&lt;/a&gt; has been a highlight - its reminded me of ways to prioritise work, wider thinking, and building emails (that one I would happily forget).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tough to keep motivated sometimes when house / building issues arise, work gets busier, and I also promised to deliver on my wife’s website. Thankfully, I’ve been here before and learned to say no in the past, but its always tough when I have promised on things that NEED to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I read up on onsite SEO, I built emailers, I planned campaigns, I somehow managed a team of builders, I stayed motivated and I managed to keep positive. &lt;br /&gt;Thank god the week is over!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ego or Self Esteem?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I use to be ok describing myself as “having a big ego”, it felt it was the right description to share how I felt, and it’s taken a good number of years to realise it’s not ego, it’s self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ego has its stigma, who wants an ego? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We’ve all worked in teams where the room is jam packed of egos, all shouting, all pressing, all wanting their point of view to be THE point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ego doesn’t back down though, &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ego doesn’t listen, &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ego can kill other people’s esteem, it can take over a room, it can dictate a room and you become the person everyone doesn’t like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that me? &lt;br /&gt;
Is that you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between ego and self-esteem is tricky to work out, purposely fooling us that both are the same, yet outwardly they are so different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ego is - envy, greed, anger, power, control, loud. &lt;br /&gt;
Self-esteem is - joy, peace, love, kindness, empathy, less powerful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ego says I know everything. &lt;br /&gt;
Self-esteem wants to learn from everyone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-esteem wants to grow and not settle, ego drowns in knowing and switching off, why learn when you know it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard the saying “leave your ego at the door”, you certainly can’t make others do this but you can check your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentored for the past 10 years, and line managed for vast amounts of my career and I’ve seen that ego has cost so many people opportunities, relationships or job promotions. Ego provides short quick gains but it’s a marathon not a 100m sprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combating this mentality is tough, if you can manage to differentiate the two, you can teach it forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I break it down to these two (hopefully simple) points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ego is a comparison tool&lt;/strong&gt; - you compare yourself to them and either justifying your growth via someone else’s failure or your ability to get the praise you need.&lt;br /&gt;
Simple comments such as “I launched a business and sold out in days” is a statement you should be proud of, but it’s also a comparison statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-esteem is also a comparison tool, but so different,&lt;/strong&gt; it compares yourself to yourself. It compares you to a previous milestone “this time last year I wanted to start a business, well I did it” or
“I started a business and I can’t believe it compared to where I was last year”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference is huge and quite obvious. Having a competitive edge against yourself is far easier to track, and it’s 100% honest and more importantly - a lot healthier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself unsure which side you are on - try a day of writing up “what you did” in bullets, and see which points stand out and what the feeling was behind them. Was it a positive “thing” that built up everyone else or yourself, or did it affect others in a negative way?&lt;/p&gt;
