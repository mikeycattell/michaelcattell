        <title>Weeknotes No.58</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am now into my last 30 days at FCA, it’s been a whirlwind of emotions - we have delivered against our targets, got everyone involved, worked with some real heroes (Neil, Brie and Andrew to name a few), and it’s been a blast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;notice-board&quot;&gt;I have availability for a new freelance design contract from the start of April 2024.  If you&apos;d like support from a seasoned designer who has seen a lot of things, it would be great to hear from you &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hello@michaelcattell.com&quot;&gt; hello@michaelcattell.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did I enjoy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As we are now in countdown mode, it’s time to start packaging up all we’ve promised and pop a lovely bow around it with instructions on how to use it. You might be wondering why is this enjoyable. To see the level of work we have done in such a short period, the support we’ve had and the cheerleading behind the scenes (see my comment for Brie and Andrew) has been nothing but lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside this, we are planning on how to ensure that time to delivery and designer-to-developer handover are handled in such a way that it keeps scaling, and working and is capable of answering many user needs and many what-ifs. Whilst this is a huge piece of work, and not a deliverable as such, we are ensuring we leave the design system in the best way possible to ensure it can live, breathe and grow without us being here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prototype kit training kicked off this week, which is always fun finding out how everyone’s computer works completely differently (proxy settings…jeez), but, again - I love teaching and this is such a win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have a roadshow next week, where we are presenting - what is UCD, why you want it and how can you go from crazy 8s to a prototype in.. minutes (a practical workshop thrown in for good measure) but the prep for this has felt great and time to flex those new FCA design system and prototype kit muscles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on Etsy as well this week - optimising our listings with tags, keywords etc, as it’s our family business it feels great to be working long hours on this and something I enjoy - data-digging is a great way to spend the evening after the kids have gone to bed and to see the results of this will be exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What am I looking forward to next week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The roadshow is going to be great to be involved in, While I’m not a permanent member of staff I do love being involved in the community and helping to pass on the knowledge of UCD and my experience as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handover of the design system is getting nearer and nearer, and it’ll be nice to get a step closer to handing it off and finally seeing it run in the wild, we still have some steps to do before this (tidying up code, training and finalising the contribution model), I honestly cannot wait to see this being used wider than the pilot teams and showing the full power of prototyping quickly and testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch of the week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I love space, obsessed with it (I’m an 80s kid after all) but watching “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m001tts2/the-space-shuttle-that-fell-to-earth&quot;&gt;The Space Shuttle That Fell to Earth&lt;/a&gt;” on BBC iplayer was game-changing - such a powerful documentary about a disaster that could have been avoided (20/20 hindsight is great…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen of the week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I did listen to a podcast my wife has recommended to me over and over again and that has anything to do with the founder of NotOnTheHighStreet.com, and it did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;
A good start is The Diary of a CEO podcast (episode 92).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.57</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Another week of working in the open, showing, presenting and teaching.&lt;br /&gt;
Loads of takeaway learning moments, a bag full of excited stakeholders and a project that is almost at the finishing line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Bobbin and Bumble is gearing up for its moment in the spotlight, which is so hush-hush, even I’m not allowed to spill the beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a bit early, but I wanted to let you know that I’ll be available for interaction design contracts from April. I’m looking forward to &lt;a href=&quot;/contact.html&quot;&gt;exploring new opportunities and collaborations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did I enjoy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This week has been intense, but in a - let’s get this thing out there and doing its thing.&lt;br /&gt;
This has involved sharing links, receiving very good feedback (with solutions.. hurrah) and having normal, adult conversations about scaling and what happens next (after I depart from the role).&lt;br /&gt;
We’ve also had 1:1 training sessions with designers, helping them initially to install or run the prototype kit in a world where proxy settings are my enemy and the hardware isn’t quite up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also been back in presentation mode, talking to stakeholders across the business to gain buy-in (we have this now) and traction to make the design system an almost compulsory “thing” to follow when designing FCA products and services - which, at one point didn’t look likely but I feel this is a huge step and one I’m so happy it’s happening!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the space of 3-4 months, we are rolling out a design system and prototype kit and I know I’ll look back at this (possibly when I write up the case study) and think - wow, you did this in a short period with multiple challenges faced and many conquered. I need a cake!&lt;br /&gt;
The past couple of weeks and months have been tough, and challenging but it proves - with a strategy to roll things out, including the right people and speaking and presenting to keep (the right) people in the loop, anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redesigning an optician website this week, met the client and all is a go-go, it’s one of the nicest designs I’ve done in a while, so I’m delighted with their feedback and trust given to me to provide them something that will edge themselves and their in-shop rebrand over local competitors and brands that spend far more on advertisement, allowing them to go for the boutique and experience vibe they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What am I looking forward to next week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Bit of a pattern now, but I just love seeing the prototype kit in people’s hands, seeing what damage they can cause moving the needle towards a more inclusive, consistent process and being a developer’s best friend when handing over a working thing with moving parts that just works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bobbin and Bumble is having a grown-up moment next week, which I couldn’t be more excited for.. but I’ll let that news be presented by someone else.. aka the owner, not me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, my current contract as Lead Interaction Designer comes to an end soon, please get in touch if you need someone like me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.56</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Is January the longest month ever? Seems to have been the start of the year for months now, is my calendar app just broken on my Macbook or phone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, work has ramped up hugely since we last spoke. The design system has gone on a roadshow (which I’ve loved seeing others talk about), people are using it, people are talking about it and there seems to be a buzz in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a soft nudge, my contract ends March 30th, so if the below or my past posts and &lt;a href=&quot;/work.html&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; around leading design in teams, or implementing a design system - feels like something you could do with - &lt;a href=&quot;/contact.html&quot;&gt;please give me a shout&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did I enjoy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If we switch gears and look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bobbinandbumble.com/&quot;&gt;Bobbin and Bumble&lt;/a&gt;, we did some planning, and I love any discovery and alpha phase of a project and this was no different. We planned out the next 6 months of work whilst I was driving to Tamworth, who needs a whiteboarding tool? I am excited to see where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-cattell/&quot;&gt;Emma&lt;/a&gt; takes this company over the forthcoming year, but I’m less excited for that to involve email design and build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to FCA, we tested the design-system’s complimentary prototype kit by handing it over to a colleague and, well it worked and worked well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Join in with me when I do a huge sigh of relief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With any design system and wider buy-in, the process is almost dot to dot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talk about the thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build the thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show the thing whilst building the thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gather feedback about the thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and then talk about the thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find ourselves somewhere between gathering feedback and presenting powerpoints, metrics, rollout plans and online or face to face training on using a prototype kit - love this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the design system are Design Principles, Accessibility Guidelines, a prototype kit, a list of 12 components and 4 patterns (all weighted against high impact, low effort), it’s been hard work to get here - but the team have been nothing but brilliant in supporting the build and providing a lot of noise around it.&lt;br /&gt;
I believe the value of a design system is clear to see, but there still needs to be work around removing the fear of additional workload and how we safely and clearly roll this out with little disruption to an already existing way of working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What am I looking forward to next week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
More of the above, we should be rolling out the design system for everyone to access, am I expecting perfection - nope, but I am expecting noise and feedback which I’m looking forward to.&lt;br /&gt;
On my e-commerce side, we are building out campaigns, and re-designing the home page, which I’m excited about (more the emailers, as working in previous roles I know first hand the potential of those).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As mentioned, my current contract as Lead Interaction Designer comes to an end soon, &lt;a href=&quot;/contact.html&quot;&gt;please get in touch&lt;/a&gt; if you need someone like me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch of the week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A short and sweet one this week, I watched this video this morning with a coffee and was in awe of what these two have done, and how they’ve done it.&lt;br /&gt;
As a co-owner (just..) of a family run business that is very much in it’s stages of scaling up, I felt the passion and mission of this presentation, and seeing the reaction from the ‘Dragons’ was incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess it is back to normal now, working (to not get any song into your head..) 9-5, an ever incoming deadline of delivery coming at me at 85mph, and a huge feeling of “it’s going all right..” - I’ll keep you posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did I enjoy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve been wanting to go to Haworth forever, and finally managed to blag the family to go, they will never doubt my trip ideas ever again. What a lovely place. I could not recommend it for a great little Sunday out, really interesting shops, a great vibe, the view is killer and the pubs are dreamy.&lt;br /&gt;
One of Yorkshire’s finest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/haworth-and-the-kids.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chasing the dream, doing emailers, planning campaigns, just eating up podcasts, and videos and speaking to inspiring friends - surround yourself with knowledge and pushers. Get you the friends that’ll shove you towards the sun and then keep them friends forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FCA-wise, we are on the home straight, the design system is looking the part, the code of it is looking ok (always wary of saying that) and it’s now in the hands of a colleague for testing and seeing if it does the do.
I am also going to do a live build-a-service in the prototype kit demo this week, crikey - that’s when you know it’s starting to get real. &lt;br /&gt;
I think this alone is a blog post, but the aim is to showcase how simple it is to build a thing in half the time of a Figma mock-up (and also include little tips about pre-meeting the team, running ideation sessions and having a thought-out journey before you load the kit), it’s going to make a great case study!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention I’m a cat owner now? We called him Mouse (to the confusion of my 2-year-old) and he’s perfectly crazy enough to slide into this family, couple him with my dog Ralph and it’s all cosy and noisy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/mouse-the-cat.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What am I looking forward to next week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Testing out the design system with an FCA colleague, whilst I’ve presented it every Wednesday, it’s time to throw it into the wild and let the team use it - I know their feedback will be valuable, useful and also thoughtful for scope - bring it on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More emailers, but these one have a plan, a strategy behind them - bobbin and bumble is getting serious this year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch of the week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Instead of just listening to one video, I thought I’d list some of my favourite retro gaming YouTubers, start 2024 with recommendations, so here we go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@Kim_Justice&quot;&gt;Kim Justice&lt;/a&gt; - one of my favourites, an absolute powerhouse of fantastic documentaries (highlights are Tresspasser and anything Sinclair Spectrum related)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@johnhancockretro&quot;&gt;John Hancock&lt;/a&gt; - taught me all I need to know about Atari and tons more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@slopesgameroom&quot;&gt;Slopes Game Room&lt;/a&gt; - if you haven&apos;t, watch his Amico breakdown of the past couple of years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@PatmanQC-Arcade-Documentaries&quot;&gt;Patman QC&lt;/a&gt; - a great historian of games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@RetroGameCorps&quot;&gt;Retro Game Corps&lt;/a&gt; - this single channel has helped me buy VERY GOOD handhelds to play games on the move (personal recommendation is the Retroid Pocket 3+)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.54</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, so it’s been a while hasn’t it?&lt;br /&gt;
Nevertheless, it’s lovely to see you again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the space of not writing weeknotes, I have changed roles from working within DEFRA (which I loved) to working on Bobbin and Bumble for a month(ish) to now, leading the design charge at FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) and implementing their first ever Design System AND Prototyping kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I touch on my time at DEFRA, it was lovely, I enjoyed it there, and will forever remember the support and the friends I made (I still speak to them now even when I left so you know it’s the real deal!). It was fun, challenging and all the right stuff that I love when working on projects, I even managed to squeeze in presenting and passing an Alpha assessment(!), but I felt it was the right time to leave, especially when there was a need back home, working on the family business that I have not touched since going back to freelance/contracting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bobbinandbumble.com/&quot; title=&quot;click here to view bobbin and bumble&quot;&gt;Bobbin and Bumble is the family business&lt;/a&gt; in case this is new to you, it’s a real living fixture in our lives, my wife started it from our dining room table with a £5 sewing machine, and it’s now a fully breathing and living thing, and knowing her products are in people’s houses (and sometimes, the people are colleagues that do not realise I’m the owners husband!). My workload varies, from building emailers to content reviewing - tracking keywords (long and short tail) and just doing general website updates, all measurable, all enjoyable and all worthwhile!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fca.org.uk/&quot; title=&quot;click to see FCA website&quot;&gt;Financial Conduct Authority&lt;/a&gt;, what a change of pace from working for myself to having deliverables, stakeholders (that isn’t my wife) and working from scratch. It’s the challenge I have been searching for a while, and it’s so enjoyable. From stakeholder meetings to presentations of the work done and what’s up and coming to writing code and shaping the future of the design within a huge organisation and taking along as many people and supporters as possible (and there are many cheerleaders here). It’s a great fit, and it keeps me and my brain busy, which is certainly what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in the past week, we went to see a pantomime at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bradfordplayhouse.org.uk/&quot; title=&quot;visit bradford playhouse&quot;&gt;Bradford Playhouse&lt;/a&gt; and it was so funny, Peter Pan has never been as funny and the cast were brilliant, my kids loved it and there was a slight smothering of naughty jokes (which the cast told me off for laughing A LOT at).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We seemed to have obtained a kitten, which was a shock to me and the children but I’ve been assured that it will support me in my mission to rid of any farm mice that seem to think it’s okay to camp out in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch of the week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xvq7CLlEkw&quot;&gt;Amy Hupe: Your design system contribution practice is doomed to fail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
I watched this before starting at FCA, and I just thought it was a great reminder of what to do or not in this case in and around contribution to a design system. It’s one of the toughest parts of implementing a design system, and something that we are parking upon launch, and working with pilot teams closely for their direct feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon launch, I see contribution as just getting the users to use the thing, getting buy-in and also growing the list of pilot teams, which seems so easy when you clumsy write it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.53</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A fortnightly version of weeknotes, thinking this might be easier to maintain at the moment - this family lark is busy!
All the kids are back to school, meaning I get to work in silence again - which, on reflection feels very much like working from home, unsure that is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;
We’ve covered a lot of ground over the past 2 weeks, While I felt like I wasn’t contributing much, I started to showcase the work covered and it’s a lot, and very much leading into our next phase (private beta) - which is just as exciting as alpha when you find out you need to change everything (jokes).&lt;br /&gt;
Mentoring again this week, from various ex-colleagues or direct reports which is just brilliant, it’s not only a warm fuzzy feeling but also confirmation that maybe I’m okay at this thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two weeks have been nothing but busy at work, we have finalised (to a point) the prototype and all feel comfortable that it’s at the level we can say &lt;br /&gt;
“yep.. this could be the thing, let’s go forward” &lt;br /&gt;
And presenting this is no mean feat, questions arise as expected and hoped, and I then use these questions (which I always write down, group into themes and present back to the core team to showcase what we haven’t made clear as of yet or answered these over the past show and share’s), to help judge where we are in regards to stakeholder or users of the service (internally) acceptance and the general temperature of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far.. so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended an internal talk at the DEFRA community meet-up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigabbott.co.uk/&quot; title=&quot;visit craig&apos;s website to learn much more&quot;&gt;Craig Abbott&lt;/a&gt;, who is the master of all accessibility. He cleared up and educated the room on a lot of the mysteries and new requirements, and it was so good to see him. He has grown from our public speaking course many years ago, where we were both nervous little whispers, to now nervous loudspeakers, who I imagine are both quite comfortable presenting.. or we pretend to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I led a workshop (surprise!) around, again finalising the full journey, but future-planning - what the heck is the final thing going to look like (balcony level), including things like touchpoints, decision points, workflow(of course) risks etc. The normal run-of-the-mill, but essential - whilst we all know this, we have never had it written down in an easy-to-read flow.. so here we are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did I enjoy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Listening to Craig’s talk, here is a link to his latest post:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigabbott.co.uk/blog/making-microservices-accessible/&quot; title=&quot;read Craig&apos;s informational post about making microservices accessible&quot;&gt;Making microservices accessible&lt;/a&gt; on craigabbott.co.uk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being much more hands-on doing the design-doing, whilst I’m the type of designer that isn’t all head-down-in-the-prototype, I love getting into the weeds of the work after all the talking, presenting, workshopping and trading of notes and post-its happens (ironically, led by myself…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing my daughter being written to personally, insisting that she join a Synconised Swimming class, as she is years above her expected ability - this isn’t a surprise, due to her insistence that she swims at least 2-4 times a week, but it’s amazing to see her grow and improve in the things she loves to do - amazing what happens when you do things that you enjoy.. schools and companies take note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What challenged me:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Google bloody merchant centre! Fudge meeee that’s a minefield. It’s a skill set I didn’t know I needed, but one I love having.
Being on top of this side of Bobbin and Bumble, means I get to see the results of our reach and add KPIs in for ourselves to measure against failure and success (hopefully the latter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am slowly coming to the end of this contract, and the unknown is starting to get near.. contracting is a murky world at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What am I looking forward to next week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Finalising the future of the service, and concreting the roadmap with the P.O. It feels like this project is taking shape and becoming very clear in it’s next steps and that is down to the team cutting back on workload and nailing presentations, risks etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being present in most of the user research sessions is enlightening and a stark reminder that this project has only just become in becoming the solution the business and the user wants. Exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending an assumptions workshop, (which we should have done weeks or even months ago, but better late than never) will allow us to finally have measurements of success or failure. This will link nicely to our design and service assumptions, but we haven’t had business assumptions for a while - I feel this was a mature step in finalising this project and helping assure the stakeholders and sponsors of the service that we are thinking of everything going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Podcast of the week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have not listened to this yet, but this podcast could be very interesting around Design Systems and their implementation of them, I’ve been there, done that and worn the very washed t-shirt, and always want to hear other people’s stories around this and how they succeed, but more importantly, where they failed (if there is such a thing in the world of iteration..).&lt;br /&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.52</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A lonnnnng week. &lt;br /&gt;
Work-wise I’m in the phase of being unsure what to work on, there are bigger things to look at, but immediate work to do - one of those weeks!
News around schools in Leeds being threatened and having them put in a “lockdown”, was shit, the world my kids are growing up within needs to look long and hard at its-self and have a talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did I enjoy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I gathered all of the user journeys from our 1st week to this a week or so before the end of alpha - showing vast iterations powered by user research sessions, presentations to subject matter experts (SMEs) and wider team(s) input and we find ourselves at a good point.&lt;br /&gt;
Seeing the above work laid on in Mural, and seeing the changes we have done from initial thoughts (we all need a starting point) to where we are now is great and reminds me of the shift we’ve all put in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listing all our assumptions, some we’ve found out, some still unanswered, and a handful we’ll look at during private beta - love this part where we start to measure against good vs. not good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being asked to present “how I settle into teams” is great, just need to remember what the heck I do and write a thing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally left the house and met a pal that I hadn’t seen for years, in fact he once hired me when he overheard me mention at a bar (whilst ordering a drink) that I just left a project styling out a Magento theme (remember those days?).. cue me walking into his office the next day on my first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What challenged me:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My daughter’s school issued warnings about being held in lockdown due to some idiots putting threats into schools. The world is fucking mad when kids are under threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working out what to work on first, it’s been tricky to prioritise, whilst it’s not a huge mass - it’s tough to work out what to do first and whether I need to do it at all. The difference between working as a consultant and a freelancer is the challenge here, as a consultant I would be expected to do everything, here I am expected to deliver high-end interaction outputs - which is much easier, but…I do not work slowly so I’m ahead of schedule!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What am I looking forward to next week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am presenting to the design community next week on how I settled in, and I’m looking forward to that, taking any questions and seeing if my process is right if there are places I could work, and gaps I could fill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Podcast of the week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Decided to reach into the vault and start to listen to one of my favourite speakers - Mike Monterio. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/mule-design-mike-monteiro/&quot;&gt;this episode&lt;/a&gt; is his usual hard-hitting, direct speaking way, which I’m a huge fan of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tune of the week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Found a band that screams, plays violin and is VERY good - Imminence, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNAD360Op_8&quot;&gt;this track&lt;/a&gt; is a complete banger.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes No.51</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there, it’s been a while, but the school holidays have also taken over my life (and a week away with friends in Turkey) and work being knee-deep in an Alpha phase that needs full-on concentration levels. 
It’s nice to be back, tracking my working week and reminding myself that it’s been going well, and whilst a tough project, an enjoyable one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did I enjoy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have made it, to the end of alpha with really great insights into users’ behaviours, not just using the prototype but their WHY, which is just as important as usability testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have validated our hypothesis’, not all positive - but that’s the point.
&lt;br /&gt;We have found things that the previous discovery team didn’t, which meant working at speed and learning very fast (it felt like an undiscovered discovery)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From all our previous workshops, we have “invented” a new tagging location, which tested so well it was scary. We shall be sharing this with the design system team when the findings are written up.
Speaking of design system teams, there is a whisper I might be involved in that again.. so I’m certainly looking forward to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What challenged me:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Whilst working at speed, it’s tough to keep on top of admin - tracking changes, tracking screen grabs and journeys - which means that I am now retro-screen grabbing previous journeys, I’m just grateful that the prototype has been structured properly and we also tracked changes, hypothesis against these changes and the reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am working on a new portfolio site, nothing heavy, in fact much simpler as it is just me who updates it. Therefore it makes no sense to put the thrills, fills and fireworks on it - whilst I will be keeping my case studies (and adding more), it will be clear as to what I do, where I do it and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What am I looking forward to next week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I’m looking forward to sharing the work that I did at HMRC on the Government Gateway, It was a great project and something I am very proud of, so keep an eye out for that.. like &lt;a href=&quot;/hmrc-security-console.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Podcast of the week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
More recently, I’ve been cutting my podcast list right down - less fluff and more educational which has changed my mindset completely.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve started to revisit Presentable, which is full of designer-led tips which are very timely, and I enjoyed Steve Parish on the High-Performance podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tune of the week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoying James Parson this week, thinking of doing a monthly playlist as it changes so regularly on tastes, would be interesting whether the music matches work or mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read of the week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I recently wanted to refresh my mind with what actually do an Interaction designer do during alpha. As an ex-consultant, I am use to being an all-rounder, doing anything and everything to get the goal done, and this post helped hugely to ensure that my worries of not doing everything was removed: &lt;a href=&quot;https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2017/04/07/things-to-consider-when-designing-in-alpha/&quot;&gt;Things to consider when designing in alpha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;What a week, busy, long and tiring and ending in rubbish weather, but you didn’t come here for the misery, you came here for the fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is a &lt;s&gt;crap&lt;/s&gt; joke to open with:&lt;br /&gt;
I tried to catch fog yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, with that out the way, on to this week’s action..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did I enjoy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Working alongside a good content designer (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/onetommyadams/&quot;&gt;Tom Adams&lt;/a&gt; hi ), is worth so much to me, pushing me constantly to do better - he has high standards and so do I, so it’s a must that we deliver something solid, useful with a heavy dollop of cost-effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love seeing my friends push themselves and seeing them trying something, seeing the ever wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuahealey/&quot;&gt;Josh Healey&lt;/a&gt; post on the NHS website is a huge thing and I love seeing him doing some really good work (spoiler: link below in read of the week)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modest warning&lt;/em&gt; - f’ing smashing it at work with a prototype that I think might be the start of a potential solution within the huge-problem-with-maps arena. But let’s see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentoring, I mean - is there anything better than seeing someone you mentor doing what you have recommended and them doing it above and beyond your expectations and them putting a spin on it and it is mega?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a moment waiting for the kettle to boil where I realised I am not the same person I was when presenting work, in the past I was too nervous to share work, too nervous to present what work was done and show confidence in the outputs and was even worse to large numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
Roll on today, I want that audience, I want the numbers, I want the challenge of presenting and I feel confident in myself, my presenting skills and I am interesting enough to listen to! I have to thank many people for this, but a huge help was a course I did with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jodarbyvoiceintheroom/&quot;&gt;Jo Darby&lt;/a&gt; who I cannot recommend enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What challenged me:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That prototype I was speaking about above, was tough work, it’s a bodge-job but it was hard going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrating my work computer to their new system.. fuuuuuuu… you know the rest.
Thinking about the future of the project, it’s now time I start planning for the private beta phase, backlog building.. it’s about time!&lt;br /&gt;
The faff around inside and outside IR35 is blowing my mind, it feels like such a bodge job (on par with my prototype) and makes zero sense sometimes, just like our tax system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What am I looking forward to next week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Dealing with the outputs from users during the UR sessions, I am hoping there are tons of goodies and we have loads to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s tough to think about, it is a bit of copy and paste, but I’m looking forward to planning for private beta, and even the assessment that awaits us, I love me some admin stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tune of the week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://michaelcattell.com/2023/07/11/weeknotes-no49.html&quot;&gt;Last week&lt;/a&gt;, I posted a much softer genre of music, but I’m back with a twist, I insist you try out &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/4EFb9FhLyFiDbYKwBwDZre?si=06cb42cbe4ed4114&quot;&gt;Electric Callboy&lt;/a&gt;, as a taster I would recommend We Got The Moves and I dare you to not nod your head to the beat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read of the week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On the NHS website: &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/design-matters/2023/why-accessible-design-is-good-design&quot;&gt;Why accessible design is good design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
I think we should all read this, it’s from a good egg Josh (two mentions in one post..) on the right side of design, who does everything in the interest of the user and is willing to go against the grain to get all users included.&lt;br /&gt;
Give it a read.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are now fully in the swing of things here, the design process is happening and even the prototype kit is finally out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fewer workshop adventures and more time spent in Visual Studio Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time in York was fun, a full day of walking, eating, talking, laughing and even learning (thanks to Jorvik Viking Centre) was a timely reminder of why I contract, and why I should take more time away from work to look around and hang with my kids during teachers training days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did I enjoy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Working with a team of designers (and I often include BA’s etc in this, UX is a team sport) is bloody great, those who say working silo is better and quicker just are lying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dusting down my brain for the prototype kit, it’s been a while but I am hoping you never lose it, as it may get complex later on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may have invented something within the Government around mapping, it’s a wait-and-see moment, all fed from last week’s workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a day off to take my beautiful daughter to York for the day, we have arranged to go to Yorvik Viking Center, eat whatever and everything and just have fun and chill together - cannot wait!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/robyn-york-july.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a photo of my lovely daughter in York on the shambles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What challenged me:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Personally, it’s been a tough week, one I won’t forget and barely even want to talk about - so I won’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work-wise, cramming in as much as possible within a week for the prototype is a little heavy, but also realising that you do not need to over-engineer something is easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What am I looking forward to next week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are finally talking to “external” users, or users - depending on how you wish to prioritise, I tend to go default and assume all other users have different titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are down to about 10-12 weeks left now, so it’s all happening - whilst I feel we are way on track, always that little doubt at the back of your mind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best news of the week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not a watch of the week, but I’m delighted to read that Hype Park Cinema is back in action, it’s one of my favourite cinemas ever and it is back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Podcast of the week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am a huge fan of Matthew Syed, I even own one of his books which I plan to read with my daughter very soon called You Are Awesome, so of course, I would recommend you listen to his time on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/5n4eSRSjdHa3yEBxJcmbWZ?si=ab3a3da6679c46cf&quot; title=&quot;listen to Matthew Syed appearance on Performance Podcast&quot;&gt;Performance Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, as usual, it was full of great insights and examples of, I guess high performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tune of the week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A bit of a change of pace this week, naming artists that are not screaming down a mic - this time it’s the smoother tones of Sam Tompkins, guessing many might not know about him yet, but if you do not.. he’s on his way up. Great singer and song writer, great on Instagram too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch of the week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
BBC iPlayer is great, but it’s even better with shows such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0fjnmbz/the-diary-of-a-ceo-series-1-5-gary-neville?at_mid=a8aj6E0RhS&amp;amp;at_campaign=TheDiaryOfACEOGaryNeville&amp;amp;at_medium=display_ad&amp;amp;at_campaign_type=owned&amp;amp;at_link_origin=discovery_cards&amp;amp;at_link_id=gr02&amp;amp;at_product=iplayer&amp;amp;at_ptr_name=bbc&amp;amp;at_ptr_type=media&amp;amp;at_format=image&amp;amp;at_objective=consumption&amp;amp;at_link_title=TheDiaryOfACEOGaryNeville&amp;amp;at_bbc_team=BBC&quot;&gt;The Diary of of a CEO&lt;/a&gt;, and this week’s turn is Gary Neville’s turn.&lt;/p&gt;
