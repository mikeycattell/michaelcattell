<h1 class="gamma">Here is a brief history of me, what I do and why I could be your best friend.</h1>

  <div class="col">

    <p><strong>I’m Michael. You can call me Michael, Mike, Mikey, or Jack. I am a digital designer.</strong> I have designed many projects like logos, websites, Emailers, mobile apps and birthday cakes. I highly suggest not asking me to design you a birthday cake, but websites I’ll gladly do.</p>

<p><strong>It all started in 2003</strong>, with online advertising at Yorkshire Post which lead me to other opportunities to expand my talents. I freelanced, and somehow ended up in America, working for a company in California leading a design team and also being their front-end developer, completely rebranding Premier Food Safety.</p>

<p><strong>Back in the UK</strong> (a lovely sunny town, Doncaster), I  ran my own company - designing, building and bringing to life what the clients vision entails. I was fortunate to work with a wide range of public and private sector clients. Working alongside Department for Work and Pensions, Remington, Jet2.com, British Airways, Argos, Regatta, and Bauer Media amongst others.</p>

<p><strong>Roll to 2016</strong>, I joined a brilliant Sky Betting and Gaming, heading up the Free-to-play squad, being lead designer of the games such as Soccer Saturday Super Six to Sky Sports Fantasy Football and ITV 7.</p>

<p>Since 2017, I’ve been running a program called Lets-Learn-Things, assisting in all type of people to learn how to design, write, draw and peel an orange access to a mentor (me!). This has proved incredibly popular with those who can’t afford tuition fees, or struggle for time due to being a single parent - so I’m incredibly proud of this and those who have joined and all got jobs via this.</p>
