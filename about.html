    <p>I like to lead teams, bringing design structure and a process for success, instilling a high level of quality and a huge focus on user needs. Working heavily alongside stakeholders, presenting the facts and figures they need to be onboard with many design
        decisions.
    </p>
    <p>Over the past 15 years, I've had the opportunity to contribute to variety of products/apps from early-stage startups to global applications, prior to Department for Work and Pensions, I've worked at Sky Bet as a designer, primimarly focusing on bringing
    a design structure to an environment that was heavily dev-led, whilst working on mobile apps and the launch of many original games, as well as a number of other agencies, and corporations. </p>

    <p>Since 2017, I’ve been running a program called Lets-Learn-Things, allowing those with a hunger to learn how to design, write, draw and peel an orange, access to a mentor. This has proved incredibly popular with those who can’t afford tuition fees,
    or struggle for time due to family commits. This is one thing I am incredibly proud and I pride myself on a great ratio of "learners" to jobs.</p>

    <p>Besides enjoy pixel-perfection (who doesn't I hear you ask), I'm also a big fan of my brilliant little family, football, craft beers, running, donuts, Pepsi Max, 2001 Space Odyssey, Disney films and listening to a lot of music and podcasts.</p>
