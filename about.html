            <h4>NHS - Reverification</h4>
            <p>Leading the design initiative and direction of a service that aims to support and encourage citizens to update and own their own demographic data, with the end goal of improving the quality and ease to contact the user when required between the phases of Discovery and Alpha.<br>
            This involved attending stakeholder meetings to decide on the direction and goals for the direction of each phase, ensuring a user centred approach within a tough environment AND business needs met in the middle.</p>
            
            <p>Leading a full design team, we delivered a strong solution which met all goals and ensured the reputation of NHS was made stronger by delivering a gold-standard service.</p>
            <h4><a href="designsystem-2022" title="read my case study on my work within the design system team">DWP - Design system</a></h4>
            <p>Working as the lead designer, I helped establish the process and ways of working within a team that was, in previous months very delivery-led.<br> 
            I kickstarted a community and contribution based way of sharing work, how to incorporate and use DWP's patterns within our prototypes and how to provide the design system with the right type of feedback to put patterns in the design system.<br>
            My role also included prototyping, presenting to stakeholders and working alongside MOD, MOJ, GDS, NHS, and DEFRA to ensure consistency amongst all design systems was met.</p>
        <h4>Universal Credits - Covid response team(s)</h4>
            <p>Leading "pop-up" teams to delivery design outputs quickly and accurately to cater for the influx of applications for Universal Credits. We managed to support 1+ million applications and lower the impact on the call center.<br>
            Outputs were html prototypes, supporting user research (remote testing) and presenting to ministers to showcase the goals.</p>
        <h4>Universal Credits - Move to Universal Credits</h4>
        <p>(Presentation available upon request)</p>
        <p>Discovery based project, where the aim was to support users upon being moved to Universal Credits by 2024. Work included leading workshops around ideation sessions, meeting and presenting back to stakeholders and ministers and delivering a presentation to an internal board to ensure budget and the project was ethical.</p>
