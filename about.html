            <p>With over 15 years of experience designing in agency, B2B and within huge industry roles for clients of all scales, my skill set covers designing services through to visual design, planning strategic approaches to launch, to sharing work using a memorable and effective story - bringing as many people into the design process as possible.</p>
            <p>Wanting to use design for a wider audience, I am passionate about including the team when making most design decisions, from initial user flows all the way through to final designs.<br>
            I love design, and put as much of myself into all my projects as possible, therefore you get a project I can be proud of and something I can present to any audience with passion, meaning and belief.</p>
