<p>I have worked with many different and amazing clients - ranging from small to large, all with their own needs and wants. Working alongside Department for Work and Pensions, Remington, Jet2.com, British Airways, Argos, Regatta, and Bauer Media amongst others where I have gained an incredible knowledge of how to work, deliver, and be an asset to others.</p>      

<p>It all started in 2003, with online advertising at Yorkshire Post which lead me to other opportunities to expand my talents. I ended up in the United States of America working for a company in California leading a design team and completely rebranding Premier Food Safety. </p>

<p>Back in the UK (a lovely <del>sunny</del> City, Leeds), I now lead design at Department for Work and Pensions as a Senior Interaction Designer. </p>
