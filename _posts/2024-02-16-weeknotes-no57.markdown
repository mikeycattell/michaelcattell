Another week of working in the open, showing, presenting and teaching.<br>
Loads of takeaway learning moments, a bag full of excited stakeholders and a project that is almost at the finishing line.

Meanwhile, Bobbin and Bumble is gearing up for its moment in the spotlight, which is so hush-hush, even I'm not allowed to spill the beans. 

Perhaps a bit early, but I wanted to let you know that I'll be available for interaction design contracts from April. Iâ€™m looking forward to <a href="/contact.html">exploring new opportunities and collaborations</a>.

<strong>What did I enjoy:</strong><br>
This week has been intense, but in a - let's get this thing out there and doing its thing.<br>
This has involved sharing links, receiving very good feedback (with solutions.. hurrah) and having normal, adult conversations about scaling and what happens next (after I depart from the role).<br>
We've also had 1:1 training sessions with designers, helping them initially to install or run the prototype kit in a world where proxy settings are my enemy and the hardware isn't quite up to the task.

We've also been back in presentation mode, talking to stakeholders across the business to gain buy-in (we have this now) and traction to make the design system an almost compulsory "thing" to follow when designing FCA products and services - which, at one point didn't look likely but I feel this is a huge step and one I'm so happy it's happening!

In the space of 3-4 months, we are rolling out a design system and prototype kit and I know I'll look back at this (possibly when I write up the case study) and think - wow, you did this in a short period with multiple challenges faced and many conquered. I need a cake!<br>
The past couple of weeks and months have been tough, and challenging but it proves - with a strategy to roll things out, including the right people and speaking and presenting to keep (the right) people in the loop, anything is possible.

Redesigning an optician website this week, met the client and all is a go-go, it's one of the nicest designs I've done in a while, so I'm delighted with their feedback and trust given to me to provide them something that will edge themselves and their in-shop rebrand over local competitors and brands that spend far more on advertisement, allowing them to go for the boutique and experience vibe they want. 

<STRONG>What am I looking forward to next week?</strong><br>
Bit of a pattern now, but I just love seeing the prototype kit in people's hands, seeing what damage they can cause moving the needle towards a more inclusive, consistent process and being a developer's best friend when handing over a working thing with moving parts that just works.

Bobbin and Bumble is having a grown-up moment next week, which I couldn't be more excited for.. but I'll let that news be presented by someone else.. aka the owner, not me!

As mentioned, my current contract as Lead Interaction Designer comes to an end soon, please get in touch if you need someone like me.
