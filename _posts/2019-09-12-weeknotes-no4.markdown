A really good week, where my place was cemented in the team and I really felt valueable and "in". Full of plenty of highs - including watching my daughter score a goal on Wednesday which meant daydreaming for the rest of the week for her to make the World Cup Final in 20 years.

<strong>Monday</strong><br>
Attended a huge team meeting, which spreads across Manchester, London and Leeds, using the biggest tv I’ve ever seen, web cameras and other incredible technology things – which was a little rocky at the start but was great to be part of and really gives the feeling of “one team”.
Much nearer to home it’s our turn for a design team gathering, discussing the struggles of knowledge / awareness of job roles and how we can help (a struggle I’ve seen many times in my career), I have plenty of ideas to help and will share in the next team meeting.

<strong>Tuesday</strong><br>
Running through the current implementation and giving some UI tweaks and prepping for a content meeting.
Confirmation that we have sign off from No. 10 to launch!
Show and tell of a product we are launching very soon, group gave feedback and it was nice to all be talking in a nice environment.
Caught up with Gavin Elliott to discuss my first 4 weeks, great to talk and run through some of my own plans and to request a Surface Pro!

<strong>Wednesday / Thursday</strong><br>
As I had flexi saved up - I took the morning off to watch Robyn's first sports day (which was great), obviously I had to join in the parent's race.
Afternoon - worked from home and answered emails and caught up with admin stuff (whilst starting to review one part of a project that’s on staging).

<strong>Thursday</strong><br>
Show and tell in the hottest room of all time, attended some and soon departed due to the popularity of the item!

<strong>Friday</strong><br>
Catching up with the content designer and user researcher and ran through the product and found a couple of things we'd like to find out with them lovely users.

Roll on UR on Monday!

<strong>Good things</strong><br>
Having flexitime is blinking brilliant and being able to actually use it is a huge plus point working here!

<strong>Learned things</strong><br>
Working together with the content design and user researcher was great – a very good 2 hours of working.

<strong>Difficulties</strong><br>
Seeing the Design team having issues with knowledge of “what designers do”, this ranges from content, ur as well as interaction designers. I have lived through this before, and will share my history of getting “buy in” from the wider team.

<strong>Achievements</strong><br>
Being the go-to person for design related questions happened this week, and it felt great!
