This week has seen a lot of interesting news happening around consultancies that I was very close to joining or have friends who work there, a lot of people looking for new roles, so if you require a designer or dev etc, look no further than the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14217012/" title="AND Digital's linkedin page for hiring">LinkedIn group AND Digital</a> set up.


<strong>What did I enjoy:</strong><br>
Prep, prep, prep - I'm a huge fan of planning before you do the work, so knowing what's coming down the line (thanks to a roadmap), I can plan alongside the DM and BA what to expect in 1-2-3 etc weeks/months and prep that Figma board already.<br>
Just doing the work, it's been busy but creatively busy - solving problems with design solutions that the team have rallied around and supported, it's a lot of presenting work for the sell-in, but it's really giving me satisfaction knowing I can do this, and do it well (modest boast there of course..), which is great for any designer's self-esteem after tricky projects.

Still awaiting confirmation I'm staying at HMRC, it's now running close to my end date!

<strong>What challenged me:</strong><br>
This week I made a couple of silly oversights which pushed back some work by only a day - these mistakes are continually annoying to me and I'm sure I'm not alone as a designer striving for perfection, most of the time it's just an oversight - things like I've copied and pasted incorrectly content or just not closed a blinking bracket so the page is out of whack, nothing massive - but the team is fully accepting of these, but it's tough to not be your tough critic!

Retro-fixing prototypes, as I prep work, I also prep my prototype structure, how to present scenarios and provide an avenue for feedback, but the prototype I have inherited isn't quite as robust for purpose, so it's taken a while to get it into a shape that I can amend and showcase work (whilst allowing users to use it freely and roam around and break things), but it's a work in progress that I can't overdo (time is money, money is time and its the taxpayers).

<strong>What am I looking forward to next week?</strong><br>
We have two ideation workshops planned, which is always exciting when it's discovery work, and this is my area of gold!<br>
Working closely with the developers in the team to finalise and check everything is ready for the MVP launch. It's crunch time!

<strong>Youtube of the week:</strong><br>
Not technically on youtube (but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp_5pDOa-o0" title="the trailer of Heaven's Gate: the cult of cults">trailer</a> is), but I am a huge fan of documentaries about Cults, and I finally got around to watching Heaven's Gate: The Cult of Cults. After listening to podcasts surrounding this, the documentary delivered and so much more. A really interesting watch, certainly worth your time if it sounds like your cup of tea.

<strong>Podcast of the week:</strong><br>
I'm sure many might of listened to this, but the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6n2LPFNEnLv32clMsC7z8A?si=a3542fa73d664ee3
" title="Spotify link to The Diary of a CEO podcast">Simon Sinek appearance on the Diary of a CEO</a> was really interesting, I often take plenty away from this podcast and this one gave me plenty.

<strong>Tune of the week:</strong><br>
Spotify did a stunner this week, it recommended a banging playlist called "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX4osfY3zybD2?si=03509b7e95d143d3">Retro running</a>", it's full of incredible bangers from the 80s and 90s.
