This week marks the start of my next step, joining the brilliant team within Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) as a Senior Interaction Designer.

If you've ever spoken to me about parts of my career, you’ll know how much I discuss my time working previously in the DWP team, up in Newcastle (Longbenton), and the learning's - which I happily stole and used successfully within Sky Bet, using techniques with a squad that was short of a design process but very willing to learn and take on these tried and tested methods to great heights.

What’s next? Designing services, products, asking questions, saying “I don’t know” and being amongst good people.

How could I not be excited?
