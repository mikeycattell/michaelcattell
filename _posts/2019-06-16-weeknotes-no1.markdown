My first week at Department for Work and Pensions.<br><br>
<em>Or: holy moly, it’s full of acronyms. </em><br><br>
As expected, it was going to be totally brain mashing, but I really enjoyed myself and feel totally out of my comfort zone - which for me is a huge positive challenge that I craved for.

<strong>Monday</strong><br>
Found my desk, filled in a little paperwork and tried to work out what I was doing (in general), also a design meet-up allowed me to meet the other Interaction Designers.

<strong>Tuesday</strong><br>
First trip to work from Harrogate (Job Centre), really good introduction to the team and a great insight into what I’ll be working on via a workshop. A lot to be said sitting back and people watching at this point (allowed by the no pressure put on me by the team).

<strong>Wednesday / Thursday</strong><br>
Setting up MacBook, sitting with Andy and Sam to find more out about the service and ask 105 questions. 

<strong>Friday</strong><br>
Feeling fully immersed in the team and kicking off my first task and getting to grips with the prototyping tool once again (how I’ve missed you).<br>
Also, first run in 3 years and managed 2k without stopping!

<strong>Good things</strong><br>
Should be called great things - the team has made me feel very welcome, and really assisted in myself settling in as quickly as I have. 

<strong>Learned things</strong><br>
As mentioned previously, staying quiet and listening sometimes is the quickest way to learn, remembering all those questions for a later time.

<strong>Difficulties</strong><br>
Tough to understand what was happening initially, and reminding myself to be ok with not knowing (as its my first week or even first month(s)).

<strong>Achievements</strong><br>
Confidence gained from being comfortable in myself to speak up, and having a team that makes me feel included as often as possible (shout out to Si, Andy and Sam for this!).
