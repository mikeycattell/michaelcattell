So it turns out my contract is in the midst of getting renewed or not, which I wasnt expecting, a different vibe, where im making sure things are working and left in great shape and hopefully a better service than when I found it!<br>
If you are requiring an contract IxD, <a href="https://michaelcattell.com/contact.html" title="get in touch and see if we can work together">get in touch</a>!

<strong>What did I enjoy:</strong><br>
This week has involved a lot of talking, answering design reasoning at speed - the kind of pressure I like!<br>
Answering queries from the helpdesk, those on the frontline picking up calls from users who are either stuck and confused, or just annoyed - this feedback is crucial and worth a ton, but this isnt me saying this is the best way to get feedback (far from it).

<strong>What challenged me:</strong><br>
Not knowing about my actual honest contract length, it feels a situation I should not really find myself in after initially being told I was in work till August, but here I am - currently contractless.

Ensuring the prototype is up to date, working and something that the next designer could use (if replaced), whilst the prototype is now in great shape - it's just a shame it's going this way.

<strong>What am I looking forward to next week?</strong><br>
I find myself with some time off now (unexpectantly), to plan my next project whilst also going on holiday so it's not all doom and gloom!<br>
BUT the doom and gloom could mean that I will be decorating my daughters bedroom and I-aint-no-DIY-lover.

<strong>Youtube of the week:</strong><br>
I haven't really seen much of Corey Feldman since the epic 80s/90s, but this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTlGthr4mi0" title="Corey Feldman interview by Mayim Bialik">interview by Mayim Bialik</a> is fantastic, and a side i've not seen really seen much off from Corey, certainly worth a watch and thoroughly interesting at how life can be cruel, but also how you could look at things and talk around forgiveness.<br>
I really respected Corey, when asked about him bringing his children up and the presenters praising him, he stops and praises his wife for playing a part too. That's worth a shout out.

<strong>Podcast of the week:</strong><br>
So, it's either football or crime, this week it's crime and the one that is hugely in the news - <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/19YkTRbToUh2IIKMgtG7rG?si=802cf571b9e94c55" title="The Murdaugh Murders podcast on the True Crime Obsessed">The Murdaugh Murders</a>, from the fantastic, amazingly funny and always-worth-a-listen True Crime Obsessed.

<strong>Tune of the week:</strong><br>
A playlist I always return to, it's got pure 90's classic on, an ever <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1MXsGYMs84cQmaUtvfmb7e?si=dc72d42138be4d53">growing playlist</a> that is richly inspired by watching TOTP2 on an evening whilst eating a burger.
