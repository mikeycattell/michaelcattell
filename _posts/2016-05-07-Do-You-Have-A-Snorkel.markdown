This is a blog post I’ve toyed with doing for sometime now, its risky to come out with it and admit it -not to my peers – they don’t pay my rent – but to my employers.

<span class="strong">I’m struggling.</span>

>Us as an industry are struggling, so many of us are painting over the cracks with “It’ll get better, there are always moments like this where I there isn’t work”.

Strangely, I wrote this as a start of a blog post early on in 2015 but never posted:

Let’s start with the beginning, its been a good year so far – busy as the first year, but something is different.

<span class="strong">Different – the understatement of 2015.</span>

2015, was the year MC Design Ltd was going to really do well, it started out on fire – I had more work than I could handle and even was turning work down, really good work as well, then IT happened, the drop. Around July/August I noticed my usual contacts were saying “sorry Mike we don’t have anything in at the moment, or the budget just happening”, and my freelance friends were making their own coffee – which we all know is a seriously matter.

I felt the panic of everyone, friends had mortgages, kids, cars, bills to pay and where was the work?

<span class="strong">Is there anything worse than a jobless freelancer?</span>

When I’m not working, I’m a monster – I loose confidence and am forever hunting online for the next thing to do.

>I swear, if I read about something “[Hustling](/hustling-no-thanks/)” again, the only thing hustling is good for is loosing your family and friends.

It’s easy to fake confidence to a client, really easy, we all do it, but can you fake not being desperate?

Having a kid totally changes your outlook on it all, I had to earn and work, maybe in that order – and freelance only works when you are in demand.

This blog post is different to most – I don’t have an answer, an ending..or work*.

The freelance struggle is real.

*As you may of read – I am now currently employed by HMRC/DWP on a contract basis, so it did happen, but I had to work hard and do a lot of digging.
