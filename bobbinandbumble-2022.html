<h3 class="intro">Introduction</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.bobbinandbumble.com/" title="click here to visit bobbin and bumble's website">Bobbin and Bumble</a> create beautiful baby & toddler accessories, intending to make their products to be portable with comfort and safety in mind. It is a UK, female-owned business supporting new and old parents.The client / my wife asked for an elegant e-commerce website and something she could use and add items to easily but, more importantly - looked nice! Also, to include social media templates and email campaign templates.
    </p>

    <h3 class="intro">The goal</h3>
    <p>We needed to decide on a useful, easy-to-use platform that supported custom styles (SASS/CSS) and showcased her projects in a way that would convert.</p>

    <p><strong>In short</strong>: Make a pretty and functional website that sold her items!</p>


    <h3 class="intro">Where to start - discovery?</h3>
    <p>To start, we worked together with mood boards/Pinterest boards to help gain a style, and a vibe and start to shape the look and feel of the brand.<br>
    We then worked out what supporting items we would need, business cards, email templates, social media branding and the type of categories we would want on the website.</p>

    <p>After this was established, we went on designing using the usual techniques of wireframing and discussing mobile and desktop views.  And then code it within a pre-set framework of Shopify.</p>
