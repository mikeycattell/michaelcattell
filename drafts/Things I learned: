Things I learned:

Work closely with your squad. Sharing every process during the design ideation period, to prototyping to development code - I shared everything I was doing to keep the team in the loop and the feeling of their involvement. This was done easily by including them in workshops, regular sketching and user journey exploration and involving them during usubility sessions.

Everyone is a user. Trying to picture the average user is always a tough process, picturing every user is easier, due to the nature of the GOV.UK website research showed that there isnt 

Exploration is key for success. Using as much data as possible, seeing onsite trends, previous submissions and talking to "real" users - we found out so much more than we ever could of imagined, and this really helped to reach a safisfactory delivery.



Love the problem - its

Your design is only as good as the content. When you’re talking about increasing trust and clarity, content is extremely important. Having content strategists involved from a very early stage allowed us to produce design that suits the content, rather than the opposite.

Fall in love with the problem, not the solution. A very valuable part of design happens away from the computer. Earlier in my career I would often jump to solutions as soon as possible without having that complete understanding of the full context. On this project I realized that by taking the time to research and listen and understand, I could not only make better solutions but it would also be faster in the long run because everyone on the team was aligned on the same goals.

Try everything. When you’re exploring design solutions to the problems you’ve discovered, make sure you try a lot of different ideas. It’s highly unlikely that your first idea ends up being the best one, but when you’ve tried everything the solution is forcibly hidden somewhere in there. For this technique to work you also have to turn down the judgmental part of your brain. Your goal here should be to produce a lot of different ideas, you’ll decide which ones make the cut after.
