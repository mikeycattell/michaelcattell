Ever since I can remember, I’ve always had an opinion, the unwritten benefit of having cockney parents means I’m very ok to communicate my approval or disapproval.

I class this as a skill, a gift - the ability to have the confidence and comfort of speaking my thoughts and challenging on what I believe to be wrong or right.

In all honestly, this confidence has not always been there, this happened and evolved over time - learning when to speak, when to listen and when to support.

Getting to this point meant breaking rules, my own rules (comfort zones are there to be stepped out of right?), changing the flow of meetings and more importantly – standing up for my own beliefs and the users, which sometimes isn’t the most popular opinion in the room, but I never want to leave a room wishing I had said something and realised just because “we are design”, doesn’t mean we are the quiet ones.

Writing down how I got to this point is tough, as it always changes depending on the company, people in the room and the context – but the pillars are always the same:

<strong>When to listen:</strong><br>

If there is a skill I always teach, it's this one. 

<blockquote>Just stop talking.</blockquote>

During my time at Sky Bet, it was important that I listened as much as possible to people who were not designers, “gifting” them have the power of the room, empowering them to have opinions on something they don't have much knowledge on and allowing the sense of comfort in the room. This (right) approach means fantastic decisions can be made by the non-designers who are just-as creative - which is where I always want the teams I work in to be, and do everything in my skillset to get them there.

Getting this trust is not an easy task, you need to be a different type of designer, one that is not precious about design, one that is approachable and more importantly one that educates. This skillset splits up the good designers to the brilliant designers.

Here at DWP, it's no different - the need to hear the SME's (Subject Matter Experts), or PM's, BA's, PTO's (I made that last one up) is so high up to learn what the actual problem is and to put distance between the problem and the solution.

I admit, this isn’t very “trouble maker” per the subject, but when was the last time you made the loud/dominate ones listen?

<strong>How did I/we get the team to this point?</strong>

I have found so many techniques; giving each person a sharpie and a handful of post-its is a big step for many designers, at first only a handful will speak and the rest will resort to writing it down - but eventually, a domino effect will happen and before you know it everyone is speaking, challenging and finding solutions that a single designer would never have thought of.

Handing the power back is one of my favourite ways-of-working, we shouldn’t be dictating the work, we should be dictating the process.

Some rules to this:<br>
<ul>
	<li>I have never "picked on" the quietest person in the room - this is not a fair approach and it’s unfair to assume they have anything to add to the meeting (or want to).</li>
	<li>I have never told anyone to stop talking - unless they have spoken over others or are going off the script.</li>
	<li>I have never started a workshop without putting down "room-rules": things like take turns to talk, (depending on numbers) hands up, write everything down, don't be a dick (work this one correctly to the tone of the room!).

</li>
</ul>

Make workshops or meetings fun, it does not need to be a serious meeting, if you plan it correctly there should be time for an ice-breaker, or a quick general chat on how everyone feels etc, starting cold only works for the few that are use to this approach. 

<strong>Support:</strong><br>

This is where my confidence comes from, knowing that others have your back.  If you have the support of others - it's a lot easier to go into a meeting with the tide than against it, and getting support is usually based on friendship, trust and respect.

Those three sound easy to gain - but I can promise you, I’ve seen many times in the past how people have skipped these and have lost arguments they should have and could have won easily.

Good designers work on relationships, great designers build on relationships.

<strong>When and how to speak:</strong><br>

Wait your turn, for heck sake PLEASE wait your turn.

Take a breath, sing any Vengboys song, score the World Cup final goal in your head - do whatever it takes, but do not speak over someone else in the meeting.

During many great management courses at Sky Bet – the biggest lesson (whilst coaching) is going back to listening, if you have ever done coaching in your career you’ll know the power of not talking.

But you can’t just listen, questioning and talking is a very quick way to really earn trust – be calculated, be tactical, be clear, but be honest.

A great line manager of mine in the past once told me that I made him feel at ease in high-level meetings – the reason was I was able to ask questions that others didn’t dare due to them feeling awkward at “it’s something they should know”, and my ability to read a room and whether I should talk or not.

Someone raises a point you aren’t sure of? Ask for more information on it, put your hand up or wait-your-turn.. and just say:
<em>“I’m a little unclear of your point – can you explain it more?”</em>

Really like something? Support it vocally – great ideas need to be praised and are often added to backlog, when a simple shout out could make it “a thing”.

<em>“I really like that idea, can we work on finding out more on it?”.</em>

These aren’t all the examples (!), but you can see its about tone-of-voice and when you talk, question and support.

All of these points have taken years for me to get to this point, it takes a lot of practice, a lot of mistakes but the secret is ALWAYS asking for feedback from colleagues, this will speed this process up of learning and correcting.

Our role as designers is to facilitate design in our teams, getting to that point is the make everyone respect each other’s creative ideas, process and to bring comfort.

I would love to hear how you got to this
