Celebrating the wins

Ask yourself - when did you last celebrate a win?

I don’t mean your favourite team winning, I don’t mean when you decide you’re having a takeaway tonight, I mean when you’ve achieved something, you’re your team has launched something or when a loved one achieved.

In the past couple of years, I’ve noticed a trend, it’s pretty daunting – I don’t see or hear the wins.

Since working alongside my wife - assisting in the web/marketing content of both the Etsy shop and website, before I got near any work I had to dig into my personal rule book and set some rules.
Why?

Before we joined forces, Emma was aiming for the stars, she wanted success - she's been doing this since 2015/2016 and she has been very successful - since 2015 (December to be exact), she has run her own company, been a full time mother - she has somehow managed to do all of this in the same 24 hours that I went to work, came home, put my daughter to bed and moan I didn't have time to watch football.

Sounds great doesn't it?

Not really, now Robyn is at school, Emma wants more success, she wants her products to rush off the shelves and be sold out in hours instead of days or weeks.
This disappointment could lead to days of un-motivation, lack of great ideas or worse - closing the company down and giving in.

So what did we change? What difference could we make to this process, to the business and to her and my success?

We simply made some rules:

We made goals
We spelled out the wins
We called out the failures.

How did we do?

Agreeing on mini goals:
Setting goals is great, it helps many things - expectations, direction and truth.
To set goals you need to think about: launch day, 1st week, 2nd week, 1 month, 3 months to 6 months and so on. What do you want to achieve in those?

How to measure success


Many people may put the success of others down to luck or a natural talent that allows them to excel at what they want to achieve. Yes, this can be the case but most of the time it is down to a particular mindset and way of looking at their goals as a whole.



Setting goals

When we talk about setting goals, achieving what we want, and living a successful life, we are talking about the far future that we want to have
