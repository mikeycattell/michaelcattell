    <p><strong>I help multidisciplinary teams deliver services in a user centred way by designing accessible experiences.</strong></p>

    <p>I'm a design leader with 16 years of experience in the public and private sectors, currently working as Lead Interaction Design at HMRC working within the Government Gateway.</p>

    <p>I have worked in various industries on several high-profile projects, including HMRC, NHS, Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), Sky Bet, British Airways, Royal Mail, GOV.UK, Sky Sports, Argos, and Jet2.<br>
    At The Department for Work and Pensions I successfully led the design and delivery of a politically charged service go-live. Joining teams from multiple sites and disciplines to produce a challenging service.</p>

    <p>In the past, I have worked contracting or as a permanent member of the team for all sizes of companies. I pride myself on being very easy to work alongside and have often slotted smoothly into any team and delivered some great services and websites.</p>

    <p>I have often worked in UK government departments or NHS within Scrum teams. I usually am known as an interaction designer, building my designs as working prototypes (in HTML/CSS/JavaScript) for usability testing.</p>

    <p>I also help support the community by sharing my expertise with designers, developers and other professions.</p>
    
    <p>More recently, I have been a principal user experience designer, using my experience to improve the digital culture and client experiences, developing and growing a team of designers and creating a safe community to learn, share and ask questions. I also work within public sector organisations, working with designers, scrum teams, and product teams whilst cracking those hard-to-solve design challenges, and leading complex and high-profile design projects in tough environments from conception to launch.</p>

    <p>I am currently SC cleared and I have BPSS clearance.</p>
