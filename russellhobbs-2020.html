    <h3 class="emma">The Problem</h3>
    <p>I was approached by Spectrum Brands to assist in their re-branding work with Russell Hobbs and Remington <a href="remingtonyourstyle-2020.html" title="click here to see yourstyle case study">Yourstyle</a> and <a href="remingtonmancave-2020.html" title="click here to see mancave case study">Mancave</a>. Their need was to deliver a very strong brand website that would allow the user to upload photos of their items in their kitchen and win a prize.</p>

<div class="grid-half">
    <h3 class="emma">The Solution</h3>
    <p>Leaning heavily on the brand, the design had to match the look and feel of a Russell Hobbs product and provide the user with a smooth way to view more products and ultimately lead to sales. <br>
    It was also one of Russell Hobbs first responsive projects, so it was not just a piece of design/build work, but also an educational piece.</p>
