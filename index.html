        <p class="intro">I help multidisciplinary teams deliver services in a user centred way by designing accessible
          experiences.</p>

        <p>As a interaction designer contractor, I mainly serve clients in the public sector, building my designs as
          working prototypes (in HTML/CSS/JavaScript) for usability testing.</p>

        <p>I am currently contracted at Financial Authority Conduct instigating and implementing their first Design
          System until 1st April 2024.</p>

        <p>I have worked in various industries on several high-profile projects, including NHS, <a
            href="designsystem-2022.html">Department of Work and Pensions (DWP)</a>, <a
            href="hmrc-security-console.html">HMRC</a>, <a href="super6-2020.html">Sky Bet</a>, British Airways, Royal
          Mail, DEFRA, <a href="fantasyfootball-2020.html">Sky Sports</a>, Man City, and Jet2.

        </p>

        <p>I take pride in my ability to work closely and seamlessly integrate into their teams. Through this approach,
          I've been able to deliver exceptional services and lead projects that meet user and business needs.</p>

        <h4><a href="2021/01/02/cheering-on-the-designer.html" title="read my post about cheering the designer">Cheering
            the designer</a></h4>
        <p>This past year was the year I started teaching, it was the year I learned more about myself than ever before
          and it was a time I learned more about others and their situations, their cultures, and their problems.</p>

        <h4><a href="2020/03/19/what-to-look-for-in-a-mentor.html"
            title="read my post about what to look for in a mentor">What to look for in a mentor</a></h4>
        <p>I’ve seen and read a lot recently about needing a mentor, the value of being a mentee and who you should use
          and look up to and I just wanted to share the framework I lean toward every time I’ve mentored with the hope
          it might help you pick the best mentor for you, and get the most out of the experience.</p>
