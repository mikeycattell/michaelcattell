  <h3>Things I do:</h3>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Let's learn things</strong><br>Join a group of eager learners who want to widen their knowledge of any field they wish (design, development, copywriting etc) with help from myself. This is open to all - irregardless of experience, gender, age or location.</li>
    <li><strong>Two Dads Do Digital</strong><br>Honest talk from two dads, both based in digital jobs (design and marketing), soap-boxing about what excites, motivates or grinds their gears. Also, about being a parent in a fast world - it’s never easy!</li>
    
  </ol>
