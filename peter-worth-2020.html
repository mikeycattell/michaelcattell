    <h3 class="emma">The Problem</h3>
    <p>I was approached by Peter from a friend's recommendation and asked if I could help design and deliver a website that would match their brand and assist in online presence.<br>There was also a need for the website to be a CMS, so we decided upon using WordPress.</p>
</div>

<div class="col grid-ninety">
    <h3 class="emma">The Solution</h3>
    <p>A simple, clean approach for the visuals of the website to match the products. Working alongside the photographer and Peter, the end solution was loved.</p> 
</div>

<div class="col grid-ninety">
    <h3 class="emma">My Responsibilites</h3>
    <p>Initial capture of the website requirements, website strategy, prototype, design, regular feedback sessions with client, work closely with photography, design iterations, development of the WordPress build.</p>
