    <h3 class="emma">The Problem</h3>
    <p>After working on the <a href="russellhobbs-2020.html" title="view my russell hobbs case study">Russell Hobbs website</a>, I was also commissioned with Remington's YourStyle. A new product, which I was approached by Spectrum Brands to assist in their re-branding work with Russell Hobbs and Remington YourStyle and Mancave. Their need was to deliver a very strong brand website that would allow the user to upload photos of their items in their kitchen and win a prize.</p>

    <h3 class="emma">The Solution</h3>
    <p>Having free-reign on the project, the design was leaning towards "what can this product do for you/it matches your style", giving the user the feeling of a personalised product that was made for them. As with Russell Hobbs, this project was one of their first responsive websites.</p>
