            <p>I have worked in various industries on several high-profile projects, including NHS, HMRC, Department of
                Work and Pensions(DWP), Sky Bet, British Airways, Royal Mail, GOV.UK, Sky Sports, Argos, and Jet2.</p>

            <p> I pride myself on being very easy to work alongside and have often slotted smoothly into any team and
                delivered some great services and websites, often working within Scrum teams.</p>

            <p> I usually am known as an interaction designer, building my designs as working prototypes (in
                HTML/CSS/JavaScript) for usability testing.</p>

                    <p><strong>NHS - Reverification (case study on way)</strong></p>

                    <p>Leading the design initiative and direction of a service that aims to support and encourage
                        citizens to update and own their own demographic data, with the end goal of improving the
                        quality and ease to contact the user when required between the phases of Discovery and Alpha.
                        <br>
                        This involved attending stakeholder meetings to decide on the direction and goals for the
                        direction of each phase, ensuring a user centred approach within a tough environment AND
                        business needs met in the middle.
                    </p>

                    <p>Leading a full design team, we delivered a strong solution which met all goals and ensured the
                        reputation of NHS was made stronger by delivering a gold-standard service.</p>

                    <p><strong>DWP - Design system</strong></p>

                    <p>Fronting the interaction design, my role was to help lead and establish ways of working that was
                        user-led, helping to meet in the middle between UCD and a delivery-led need.</p>

                    <p>Instigating a community and contribution-led model, allowing the wider design team ownership of
                        our backlog, how we incorporate and use DWP's patterns within our prototypes and a way to
                        provide effective feedback on existing and future patterns.<br>
                        Discussions with other Government depts who were running their own Design system were a constant
                        thread throughout my time.</p>

                    <p><strong>Universal Credits - Covid response team(s)</strong></p>

                    <p>Leading multiple teams to deliver design outputs quickly and accurately to help support the
                        influx of users applying for Universal Credits during a testing time for many. <br>
                        As a team, we provided a service to support 1+ million applications with a very short timeframe
                        and lower the impact on the call center staff.</p>

                    <p><strong>Universal Credits - Move to Universal Credits team</strong><br>
                        (Presentation available upon request)</p>

                    <p>A discovery led project, where the aim was to support users being moved to Universal Credits by
                        2024. My duties included leading ideation workshops, presenting to stakeholders and ministers
                        and delivering and defining a presentation to an internal board (intelligent challenge) to
                        ensure project budgets were secured and projected correctly and to ensure the project was
                        ethical and in the users best interest to keep going.</p>
